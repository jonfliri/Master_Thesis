<span id="chapter-installation"></span><h2><span class="sectnum">1.</span> Installation of AnyBody<a class="headerlink" href="#installation-of-anybody" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section describes the basic installation of the AnyBody Modeling
System on a computer. Firstly, the requirements for the installation are
described and next, the installation process is described. For a
floating network license setup, this also covers the setup for the
client computers running the AnyBody software.</p>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h3><span class="sectnum">1.1.</span> Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Computer:</strong></dt><dd><dl>
<dt>Operating system:</dt><dd><p>AnyBody runs only on standard Windows PC computers with
Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 operating systems. The Windows 10
service models (Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted) (SAC-T)
Semi-Annual Channel (SAC) Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC)) is
supported in the following way:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The AnyBody Modeling System is supported for running on
Semi-Annual Channel, and since AnyBody is not heavily
integrated with Windows it is expected to run on Semi-Annual
Channel (Targeted) and Long Term Servicing Channel branches as
well. AnyBody is routinely tested on Windows Semi-Annual
Channel (Targeted), so any serious issues caused by updates to
Windows are addressed in a timely fashion.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>AnyBody may work on earlier Windows operating systems, but this
is not supported. The 64 bit version of AnyBody requires a 64
bit Windows in order to run.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Memory:</dt><dd><p>AnyBody will in principle run on very little memory, but if you
have less than 256 MB available to AnyBody, you will only be able
to run very small models. Larger models typically require 512 MB
or more, and a full-body model does not run well on less than 2
GB. Exporting high-resolution imagery can also require extra
memory.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Working with full-body models, a minimum of 2GB ram is required
and 4GB recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>Notice that the 32 bit version of AnyBody is built with Large
Address Awareness meaning that it can use more than the
standard 2GB of memory for 32 bit programs. On 64 bit Windows
systems, the 32 bit version AnyBody can use up to 4GB and on 32
bit Windows systems proper modification of system options can
bring it to use up to 3GB of memory. The 64 bit version of
AnyBody can utilize the complete amount of memory available on
a 64 bit Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Running large models with large data sets, e.g. from MOCAP with
many samples may required gigabytes of memory; a 64 bit Windows
system is therefore recommended for advanced modeling.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Processor:</dt><dd><p>AnyBody should work on any processor capable of running the
recommended operating systems, but the faster the better. Large
models are computationally demanding.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Graphics:</dt><dd><p>A graphics adapter with OpenGL 3.0 support is a minimum
requirement. CPU-integrated graphics adapters using shared memory
are supported, but a dedicated graphics adapter with at least 1GB
of memory is recommended, especially when exporting high
resolution imagery.
If AnyBody is used through a Windows Remote Desktop Connection, a
graphics adapter with OpenGL drivers specifically supporting Remote
Desktop Connections are required in order to get hardware graphics
acceleration. The Nvidia Quadro series of graphics adapters are
known to support OpenGL on Remote Desktop Connections.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Hard drive:</dt><dd><p>At least 4.0GB of free disk space is recommended for installation
and model work.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Web Browser:</dt><dd><p>The AnyBody Modeling System requires that Microsoft Internet
Explorer 9.0 or later is installed on the computer; newest version
is recommended. Older versions may result in reduced functionality
of the AnyBody GUI, but the core simulation functions are not
affected.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SOLIDWORKS:</dt><dd><p>The AnyBody Exporter for SOLIDWORKS translator add-in requires
SOLIDWORKS to be installed in order to work.</p>
<p>The AnyBody Exporter for SOLIDWORKS add-in is currently
supported for SOLIDWORKS 2012 to SOLIDWORKS 2020.
It may function on earlier or newer versions as well due to the
generality of the SOLIDWORKS API, but this is generally not
supported.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Python:</dt><dd><p>The AnyBody Modeling System implements an interface for using
Python functionality in models. The AnyBody Modeling System
installation includes a Python 3.7 distribution, but a
user-selected Python installation is also supported. Supported
versions of Python are 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8. The 32 bit
version of AnyBody can interface with a 32 bit Python
installation, and the 64 bit version of AnyBody can use a 64 bit
Python installation.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><strong>User Account:</strong></dt><dd><p>Your Windows user account must have administrative privileges
during the installation process.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You may also need administrative privileges while entering
license keys (importing license files). License keys are entered
and license files are imported via AnyBody’s License Manager
that opens the first time the AnyBody Modeling System is
started.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><strong>License:</strong></dt><dd><p>You must have a valid license file. A license file is a text
file, typically with the extension “.lic”.
(If you do not have a license file, you can request an
evaluation license from
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.anybodytech.com">www.anybodytech.com</a>.)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can open the license file and inspect the data:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Notice!</dt><dd><p>Do not modify the file or it will become invalid.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Customer information</dt><dd><p>should match your name or your organization’s name.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Product/license string:</dt><dd><p>The product string combines product name and license type
connected by an ’_’ character, i.e.,
&lt;ProductName&gt;_&lt;LicenseType&gt;. Product names can currently be one
of the following:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>ams4:</dt><dd><p>License for the fundamental module of the AnyBody Modeling
System, including the AnyBody GUI and the console
application interfaces.</p>
</dd>

</dd>
<dt>Host-id:</dt><dd><p>Licenses are typically bound to a computer, a dongle, or
similar. This is done by associating the license with a host-id
that identifies the device.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The host-id must be sent to AnyBody Technology before the
license can be issued.</p></li>
<li><p>Host-id for a standalone license can be found by the
AnyBody software. AnyBody’s License Manager will assist you

<p>AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS needs both SOLIDWORKS and the AnyBody Modeling
System in order to function. AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS is installed on your
hard disk from the regular AnyBody installer.</p>
<p>In order to make sure that the add-in is installed, you must choose to
either do a complete AnyBody installation, or you must specifically
select to install the AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS add-in from the Tools section
when doing a custom installation.</p>
<div class="line-block">

<h3><span class="sectnum">1.5.</span> Using AnyBody through Remote Desktop Connection<a class="headerlink" href="#using-anybody-through-remote-desktop-connection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The AnyBody Modeling System requires OpenGL 3.0 support, but connecting
to a computer using Windows Remote Desktop Connection will typically
only allow support for OpenGL 1.1, which will result in the Model View
and Chart View not working.
Certain graphics adapters such as the Nvidia Quadro series are
known to support OpenGL on Remote Desktop Connections.
A workaround for this limitation is to use a
software OpenGL renderer instead. The 64 bit version of the
AnyBody Modeling System ships with an appropriate OpenGL software
renderer which can be installed manually by the user.</p>
<p>Installation procedure for enabling software OpenGL rendering:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Open the AnyBody Modeling System, open the <span class="menuselection">Tools ‣ Settings</span> dialog and
change the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Chart.Chart_View.AntiAlias</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Model_View.AntiAlias</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Camera.AntiAlias</span></code> values to 0.</p></li>
<li><p>Close the AnyBody Modeling System.</p></li>
<li><p>Open a File Explorer and go to the AnyBody Modeling System
installation location and copy the file named <code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">opengl32.dll</span></code> from the
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AssistSoftwareOpenGL</span></code> subfolder to the
AnyBody installation folder, so that it is placed alongside the
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AnyBody.exe</span></code> file.</p></li>
<li><p>When you start the AnyBody Modeling System again, it will now use the
software OpenGL renderer.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In order to revert to hardware OpenGL acceleration, please revert the
steps mentioned above.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Using a software OpenGL renderer will result in much worse
performance regarding Model View update speed, as well as loss of
antialiasing support.</p>

<p>When the license file is imported, it is copied and renamed to a special
location where AnyBody will look for it. The imported file is always
renamed to license.lic and previously imported files are renamed before
overwriting them. This means that old license files remain in the system
and can be located.</p>
<p>AnyBody will look for the license file in three locations in the
following order.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>In the directory of AnyBody executables. This location is not used
for imported licenses; it is merely searched for trouble shooting
purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>Licenses imported for your personal user are located in a

<h3><span class="sectnum">4.1.</span> Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In order to set up your RLM license server for AnyBody license
management, you need the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>A valid license file.</p></li>
<li><p>The RLM server executable and utilities for your server platform.</p></li>
<li><p>A file identifying AnyBody Technology for the RLM license server.
This is referred to as an ISV definition file. This can be a platform
independent server settings file (called anybodytch.set) or an
executable (e.g. anybodytch.exe) for your specific server platform.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Item 2 and 3 you can download from
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.anybodytech.com/download.html?did=license_server">www.anybodytech.com/download.html?did=license_server</a>.
You must log onto the AnyBody Technology website to get to the download
area. Reprise Software may deliver more and newer RML distributions than
currently supported by AnyBody Technology. These can be downloaded from
the Reprise Sofware website.</p>
<p>The license file is a text file (<cite>*.lic</cite>), similar to the node-locked
license files described in the previous sections. The difference is that
the license file for a floating license server contains some additional
lines defining the server. This includes the server’s name, host-id, and
optionally a TCP/IP port number.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>You must send your server host-id to AnyBody Technology before
the license file can be issued. The host-id is typically the MAC number
of the primary ethernet card.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you need to run the RLM license server on a virtual machine
you will have to contact AnyBody Technology, as this requires a special
license file setup. In this case you will need to send the host-name of
the virtual machine as well as the host-id (MAC address) of the virtual
machine to AnyBody Technology.</p>

<div class="section" id="a-typical-license-server-setup">
<h3><span class="sectnum">4.2.</span> A typical license server setup<a class="headerlink" href="#a-typical-license-server-setup" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A typical license server installation include:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Install the RLM license server executable, i.e., unpack it in your
choice of directory on your server (If you already have an RLM
license server running, you can use this one).</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the ISV definition file to the same directory (This is the
typical and recommended setup, but the file can be located in another
directory. Please refer to the RLM End-User Manual for more details)</p></li>
<li><p>Copy your license file to the same directory (This is the typical and
recommended setup, but the file can be located in another directory.
Please refer to the RLM End-User Manual for more details)</p></li>
<li><p>Check and if needed modify the hostname and TCP/IP port number in the
first line (The HOST line) of the license file. The hostname and port
number can be changed without invalidating the license file. On a
Windows-based server, the hostname can be found by using the command
“ipconfig /all” in a command prompt.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The host name is the first argument of the HOST line.</p></li>
<li><p>The TCP/IP port number is the third argument in the HOST line. It
may be omitted in which case the default port is 5053 (Notice that
RLM version 5 and older used 28000).</p></li>
<li><p>The second argument is the host-id. This must not be changed or
the license file becomes invalid.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If the client computer will be contacting the server through a VPN
connection, it might be advantageous to set up the RLM license server
to free licenses after the client computers have lost VPN contact
with the license server computer. This can be done by creating an
empty “anybodytch.opt” file in the same folder as the RLM executable
on the license server computer. The anybodytch.opt file must contain
the following line:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">TIMEOUT</span> <span class="mi">3600</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will free licenses used by remote client computers which have
been out of contact with the license server computer for more than an
hour.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Modify the firewall of the server to allow incoming connections on
the ports used by RLM.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>On a Windows license server, the rlm.exe license server program
can be added to the firewall exceptions. This should allow
connections on the ports used by both RLM itself and the ISV
license server started by RLM.</p></li>
<li><p>On a license server with a port number based firewall, it may be
necessary to add both RLM’s own port number (by default 5053 on
RLM v6 and later), and the port number of the RLM AnyBody ISV
license server to the firewall port exceptions. The AnyBody ISV
license server can be set to use a specific port number by
specifying it in the ISV line of the server license file. For
further details on how to specify this, please refer to the RLM
End-User Manual.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Start up the license server. The license server can either be started
as a normal program or as a service.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To start the RLM license server as a normal program, navigate to
the RLM license server folder and start the RLM license server by
executing rlm.exe. Please note that in this case the license
server will only be serving licenses while this program is
running.</p></li>
<li><p>If the RLM license server is installed as a service, the RLM
license server will automatically begin serving licenses when the
server computer is started. To install the RLM license server as a
service on a Windows server computer, please do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open a command prompt with administrator privileges
(right-click the command-prompt icon and select “Run as
administrator”).</p></li>
<li><p>Execute the following command in the command prompt:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Start the rlm service by manually going to the Windows
Services, finding the new RLM service, selecting it and
starting it, or by rebooting the license server computer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The RLM license server can also be started as a service on Unix
systems. For more details, please refer to the RLM End-User
Manual.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Set up your client computers</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Install AnyBody as described in the previous sections.</p></li>
<li><p>Import the license file. The same file as on the license server
can be used, but in principle it only needs the first line; only
server host-name and port number is needed.</p></li>

<p>Below is a list of typical issues associated with setting up the license
server.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>License server is not started.</p></li>
<li><p>The license file is missing on the server.</p></li>
<li><p>The AnyBody Technology definition file (anybodytch.set or
anybodytch.exe) is missing in the license server setup.</p></li>
<li><p>Client and server does not communicate on the same port, either
because different ports numbers are specified in the server and
client side license files or because the default port number is used
and different versions of RLM technology uses different ports.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>An RLM option file is available for enabling logging of issues
regarding the license server. A log file of this kind is needed when
contacting AnyBody Support about license server related issues.</p>
<p>The typical and recommended setup is to create a file called
’anybodytch.opt’ in the RLM license executable folder, if it does not
already exist. The file must contain the following line:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">REPORTLOG</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">anybodytch1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nb">log</span> <span class="n">std</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Place the option file in the same directory as the license file that
is read by the license server. Restarting the license server, a log
file with the specified name will be created and updated during the
license service.</p>
<p>Please refer to the RLM End-User Manual, Chapters ’The License File’
and ’The ISV option file’, for more details.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The status of the RLM license server on the license server computer
can be viewed by running the following command in a command prompt in
the license server computer RLM executable folder:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">rlmutil</span> <span class="n">rlmstat</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">a</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The output from this command will provide information on what ports
RLM is using, what ISV license servers are running, and what licenses
are being served and used. If you need to contact AnyBody support
regarding a floating license issues, please include the output from
this command.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The connection between an RLM server and a client computer can be
tested in the following way.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unpack the RLM installation package to a folder on the client
computer to be tested.</p></li>
<li><p>First, on the license server computer, run the following command
line in the RLM license server executable folder:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">rlmtests</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">s</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Second, on the client computer, run the following command line in
the folder where you unpacked the RLM installation package (with
&lt;server hostname&gt; replaced by the actual RLM license server
computer hostname):</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">rlmtests</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">server</span> <span class="n">hostname</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>The client computer will now begin trying to contact the RLM
license server computer, and the output in the client computers
command prompt will display whether the tests are successful.</p></li>
