Installation of AnyBody
=======================

This section describes the basic installation of the AnyBody Modeling
System on a computer. Firstly, the requirements for the installation are
described and next, the installation process is described. For a
floating network license setup, this also covers the setup for the
client computers running the AnyBody software.

Requirements
------------

**Computer:**
   Operating system:
      AnyBody runs only on standard Windows PC computers with 
      Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 operating systems. The Windows 10
      service models (Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted) (SAC-T)
      Semi-Annual Channel (SAC) Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC)) is
      supported in the following way:

      -  The AnyBody Modeling System is supported for running on
         Semi-Annual Channel, and since AnyBody is not heavily
         integrated with Windows it is expected to run on Semi-Annual
         Channel (Targeted) and Long Term Servicing Channel branches as
         well. AnyBody is routinely tested on Windows Semi-Annual
         Channel (Targeted), so any serious issues caused by updates to
         Windows are addressed in a timely fashion.

      AnyBody may work on earlier Windows operating systems, but this
      is not supported. The 64 bit version of AnyBody requires a 64
      bit Windows in order to run.

   Memory:
      AnyBody will in principle run on very little memory, but if you
      have less than 256 MB available to AnyBody, you will only be able
      to run very small models. Larger models typically require 512 MB
      or more, and a full-body model does not run well on less than 2
      GB. Exporting high-resolution imagery can also require extra
      memory.

      -  Working with full-body models, a minimum of 2GB ram is required
         and 4GB recommended.

      -  Notice that the 32 bit version of AnyBody is built with Large
         Address Awareness meaning that it can use more than the
         standard 2GB of memory for 32 bit programs. On 64 bit Windows
         systems, the 32 bit version AnyBody can use up to 4GB and on 32
         bit Windows systems proper modification of system options can
         bring it to use up to 3GB of memory. The 64 bit version of
         AnyBody can utilize the complete amount of memory available on
         a 64 bit Windows.

      -  Running large models with large data sets, e.g. from MOCAP with
         many samples may required gigabytes of memory; a 64 bit Windows
         system is therefore recommended for advanced modeling.

   Processor:
      AnyBody should work on any processor capable of running the
      recommended operating systems, but the faster the better. Large
      models are computationally demanding.

   Graphics:
      A graphics adapter with OpenGL 3.0 support is a minimum
      requirement. CPU-integrated graphics adapters using shared memory
      are supported, but a dedicated graphics adapter with at least 1GB
      of memory is recommended, especially when exporting high
      resolution imagery.
      If AnyBody is used through a Windows Remote Desktop Connection, a
      graphics adapter with OpenGL drivers specifically supporting Remote
      Desktop Connections are required in order to get hardware graphics 
      acceleration. The Nvidia Quadro series of graphics adapters are 
      known to support OpenGL on Remote Desktop Connections. 	  

   Hard drive:
      At least 4.0GB of free disk space is recommended for installation
      and model work.

   Web Browser:
      The AnyBody Modeling System requires that Microsoft Internet
      Explorer 9.0 or later is installed on the computer; newest version
      is recommended. Older versions may result in reduced functionality
      of the AnyBody GUI, but the core simulation functions are not
      affected.

   SOLIDWORKS:
        The AnyBody Exporter for SOLIDWORKS translator add-in requires
        SOLIDWORKS to be installed in order to work.

        The AnyBody Exporter for SOLIDWORKS add-in is currently
        supported for SOLIDWORKS 2012 to SOLIDWORKS 2020.
        It may function on earlier or newer versions as well due to the
        generality of the SOLIDWORKS API, but this is generally not
        supported.

   Python:
      The AnyBody Modeling System implements an interface for using
      Python functionality in models. The AnyBody Modeling System
      installation includes a Python 3.7 distribution, but a
      user-selected Python installation is also supported. Supported
      versions of Python are 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8. The 32 bit
      version of AnyBody can interface with a 32 bit Python
      installation, and the 64 bit version of AnyBody can use a 64 bit
      Python installation.

**User Account:**
   Your Windows user account must have administrative privileges
   during the installation process.

   -  You may also need administrative privileges while entering
      license keys (importing license files). License keys are entered
      and license files are imported via AnyBody’s License Manager
      that opens the first time the AnyBody Modeling System is
      started.

**License:**
   You must have a valid license file. A license file is a text
   file, typically with the extension ".lic".
   (If you do not have a license file, you can request an
   evaluation license from
   `www.anybodytech.com <http://www.anybodytech.com>`__.)

   -  You can open the license file and inspect the data:

      Notice!
         Do not modify the file or it will become invalid.

      Customer information
         should match your name or your organization’s name.

      Product/license string:
         The product string combines product name and license type
         connected by an ’_’ character, i.e.,
         <ProductName>_<LicenseType>. Product names can currently be one
         of the following:

         ams4:
            License for the fundamental module of the AnyBody Modeling
            System, including the AnyBody GUI and the console
            application interfaces.

         ae4sw:
            License for the AnyBody Exporter for SOLIDWORKS translator
            add-in (AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS).

         amsall1:
            A combined license for all independent modules of the
            AnyBody Modeling System installation packages.

         ams4_processing:
            A special processing license for running the AnyBody Batch
            Processing System console applications.

      License types:
         <ProductName>_standard:
            License for the standard version of the product or module.

         <ProductName>_non_faculty_research:
            License for the non-faculty research version of the product
            or module.

         <ProductName>_research:
            License for the research version of the product or module.

         <ProductName>_student:
            License for a student version of the product or module.

         <ProductName>_trial:
            License for a trial version of the product or module.

      Host-id:
         Licenses are typically bound to a computer, a dongle, or
         similar. This is done by associating the license with a host-id
         that identifies the device.

         -  The host-id must be sent to AnyBody Technology before the
            license can be issued.

         -  Host-id for a standalone license can be found by the
            AnyBody software. AnyBody’s License Manager will assist you
            in finding host-id options that can be sent to
            AnyBody Technology. Please refer to the next section.

         -  Floating network licenses are bound to a license server.
            Please refer to a later chapter in this manual for more
            details on this.

Installation Procedure
----------------------

#. Access to the software:

   A self-installing exe file is available at
   `anybodytech.com/download.html?did=anybody.overview <http://www.anybodytech.com/download.html?did=anybody.overview&loc=PDFGuide>`__.
   
   .. note:: It requires AnyBody Web-user login. If you are not a registered
      web-user already, you must register an account on the login page.

   .. The setup file is typically called :file:`AnyBodySetup.{v1}.{v2}.{v3}.{v4}_x64.exe`,
   .. where **v1**, **v2**, **v3**, and **v4** are digits of the version number. The
   .. setup file for the 64 bit version of AnyBody is called for example called 
   .. ``AnyBodySetup.7.3.0.8065_x64.exe`` .


#. Install and launch AnyBody:

   #. Run the setup exe file and follow the instructions in the
      installation wizard.

   #. Custom installation allows you to select the installation
      directory and select components. Notice that the install wizard’s
      choice of directory prepares for coexistence with older and future
      versions.

   #. In order to install optional Tool components of the
      AnyBody package such as the AnyBody Exporter for SOLIDWORKS
      add-in, you must either do a full installation or select the
      specific tools when selecting components for a custom
      installation.

   #. During the final part of the installation, drivers for AnyBody’s
      hardware dongles (HASP dongles) may be installed if relevant
      drivers are not found on your computer.

   #. Finalize:

      #. Choose to launch AnyBody as the final step; this will bring you
         to Step 3.

      #. Choose to open Add/Remove Programs to remove older versions of
         AnyBody. This can always be done later.


#. Register your license(s):

   #. If AnyBody is installed for the first time, or for other reasons
      no valid license is found, AnyBody’s License Manager will appear
      when you launch AnyBody.exe.

   #. If you have a valid license already, select Import License File,
      browse for your license file, and import it.

      -  You can choose to import the license for all users of the
         computer, or just for your own user account.

      -  You may need administrative priviledges during the process, if
         you install the license for all users.

      -  If you have a dongle-bound license, insert the USB-dongle while
         installing the license. The license will be validated during
         the process.


   #. If you have purchased a license, but have no license file yet, you
      may need to send host-id information to AnyBody Technology. From
      the License Manager dialog, you can gather this information:

      - Insert your dongle, if relevant.

      - The "View host IDs" button will open a dialog with the possible
        Host-IDs. From here they can be sent to AnyBody Technology.


   #. If you have not bought a license, you can select a trial license.

      - Trial licenses are special computer-bound licenses valid for 30
        days. The "Get trial license" button will bring you to the
        AnyBody Technology webpage where you can request a license key.


   #. Pressing OK after entering a valid license will launch AnyBody.


   #. You can enter new licenses later from the menu Help->Registration.
      This will bring up the AnyBody License Manager dialog.



.. note::
   #. If you need assistance with the installation, please contact
      AnyBody support at support@anybodytech.com or phone +45 9635 4286.

   #. A free forum providing support is available at the
      `www.anyscript.org <http://www.anyscript.org>`__ along with a lot
      of resources. The web-user login you have used at
      `www.anyboytech.com <http://www.anybodytech.com>`__ is also valid
      at `www.anyscript.org <http://www.anyscript.org>`__ and vice
      versa.

   #. AnyBody’s console application cannot register licenses. It will
      only run if a valid license has been entered from AnyBody’s GUI.


Installing AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS
----------------------------

AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS needs both SOLIDWORKS and the AnyBody Modeling
System in order to function. AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS is installed on your
hard disk from the regular AnyBody installer.

In order to make sure that the add-in is installed, you must choose to
either do a complete AnyBody installation, or you must specifically
select to install the AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS add-in from the Tools section
when doing a custom installation.

| |image1|
| |image2|


AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS requires a separate license, which is typically
located in the same file as your AnyBody license. Importing the
license file into AnyBody through the license manager will place the
file in the proper location for AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS to find it.

Loading the AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS add-in
------------------------------------

AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS is delivered in the form of a DLL (Dynamic Link
Library), which can be loaded as an add-in from SOLIDWORKS by doing the
following steps.

#. Start SOLIDWORKS with administrator rights (use the "run as
   administrator" feature). It is only necessary to run SOLIDWORKS as
   administrator when importing the add-in, afterwards it can be started
   as normal.

#. Choose the menu :menuselection:`File --> Open`.

#. In the file dialog, select "Add-Ins (``*.dll``)" file extension type
   and choose the AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS DLL file.

|image3|

The AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS DLL can be found in the AnyBody installation,
ypically in the folder :file:`C:\Program  Files\AnyBody Technology\AnyBody.{X.X}\Tools\AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS`,
where ``X.X`` indicates the AnyBody version number.


After you have loaded the AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS module successfully, you
can see that the AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS module appears in the SOLIDWORKS menu bar.

|image4|

You are now ready to use SOLIDWORKS as a powerful model authoring tool
for the AnyBody Modeling System.

Using AnyBody through Remote Desktop Connection
-----------------------------------------------

The AnyBody Modeling System requires OpenGL 3.0 support, but connecting
to a computer using Windows Remote Desktop Connection will typically
only allow support for OpenGL 1.1, which will result in the Model View
and Chart View not working. 
Certain graphics adapters such as the Nvidia Quadro series are 
known to support OpenGL on Remote Desktop Connections.
A workaround for this limitation is to use a
software OpenGL renderer instead. The 64 bit version of the
AnyBody Modeling System ships with an appropriate OpenGL software
renderer which can be installed manually by the user.

Installation procedure for enabling software OpenGL rendering:

#. Open the AnyBody Modeling System, open the :menuselection:`Tools --> Settings` dialog and
   change the ``Chart.Chart_View.AntiAlias``, ``Model_View.AntiAlias`` and
   ``Camera.AntiAlias`` values to 0.

#. Close the AnyBody Modeling System.

#. Open a File Explorer and go to the AnyBody Modeling System
   installation location and copy the file named :file:`opengl32.dll` from the
   :file:`Assist\SoftwareOpenGL` subfolder to the
   AnyBody installation folder, so that it is placed alongside the
   :file:`AnyBody.exe` file.

#. When you start the AnyBody Modeling System again, it will now use the
   software OpenGL renderer.

In order to revert to hardware OpenGL acceleration, please revert the
steps mentioned above.

.. warning:: Using a software OpenGL renderer will result in much worse
   performance regarding Model View update speed, as well as loss of
   antialiasing support.

.. _chapter:UninstallingOrRepairing:

Uninstalling or Repairing AnyBody
=================================

#. You must access the install wizard again for removal and repair of
   the AnyBody installation. You have several options:

   #. Use "Add or Remove Programs" from the Windows Control Panel.

   #. Run the self-installing exe file again.

   #. Run the online installation.

#. HASP dongle drivers:

   #. If the drivers for the HASP dongles did not install properly
      during the installation you can install them by executing the HASP
      installation package in the directory, where AnyBody is installed
      or from the Windows Start Menu: :menuselection:`Start --> AnyBody Technology -->
      AnyBody.x.x --> Tools`. The available HASP installation package is
      an MSI package.

   #. You can get information about the drivers’ versions from :menuselection:`Start -->
      AnyBody Technology --> AnyBody.x.x --> Tools --> About...` This will
      reveal the installed versions of the drivers as well as the ones
      supplied with this version of AnyBody.

   #. You can remove or repair the drivers from Add/Remove Programs in
      the Windows Control Panel or you can run the HASP installation
      package again as mentioned above. This is also an option when
      running a maintenance/repair installation of AnyBody, either from
      Add/Remove Programs or by running the self-installing exe file.

   #. The most current drivers from our supplier, Aladdin, can be
      downloaded from
      http://www.aladdin.com/support/hasp/enduser.asp.

.. _chapter:VersionsAndLicensing:

Introduction to AnyBody Versions and Licensing
==============================================

Version number:
   AnyBody is designated a minimum three digit version number:

   -  First digit is the Major Version Number.

   -  Second and third digits are the so-called Minor Version Numbers.

   -  The third digit is incremented for all smaller updates such as
      bugfixes and patches. Such updates may not be officially announced
      and they will install as updates to the same version with lower
      third digit.

   -  Versions with different first and second digit can coexist on your
      computer. They install as separate packages and must be
      uninstalled independently.

   -  Additional version digits and build numbers merely serve to
      identify a particular build of AnyBody and they are of no pratical
      significance to the end-users.

License types:

   -  Temporary trial licenses are available for evaluation purposes.
      You can request a trial license on
      `www.anybodytech.com <http://www.anybodytech.com>`__. Please
      notice that you must register as a web-user of the site before
      being able to access the software.

   -  Licenses for educational, research, and commercial use are
      available. Please inquire at
      `www.anybodytech.com <www.anybodytech.com>`__.

   -  Licenses for running additional console application instances of
      the AnyBody Modeling System for processing large datasets are
      available. Please inquire at
      `www.anybodytech.com <www.anybodytech.com>`__.

License files:

   -  All license types are distributed as license files. The installed
      software is in principle the same in all cases.

   -  Licenses are bound to a unique identifier of the host computer.

      Network adapter:
         Node-locked licenses are typically bound to the MAC address of
         the host computer’s network adapter (the physical adapter
         address). Node-locked license may allow one or more instances
         of AnyBody to run on the computer simultanously.

      Dongles:
         Licenses can be bound to dongles (HASP dongles from Aladdin).
         Standalone dongles for USB or LPT ports must be inserted in the
         computer for AnyBody to run.

      Floating network licenses
         (or concurrent licenses) are also available. Floating licenses
         are bound to a license server, which is a computer on the
         network. Floating licenses can be counted multi-user licenses.

License concurrency:

   -  A single AnyBody license can be used for simultaneously running up
      to 4 instances of the AnyBody GUI or console application, or any
      mix thereof.

   -  All shared instances of AnyBody from a single license must be run
      by the same user. If a different user wants to run AnyBody
      simultaneously on the same computer, this requires another license
      checkout.

The License File
----------------

The license file is a text file typically with the extension ".lic". It
can hold one or more licenses that are in readable text format. The
licenses are digitally signed so that the license becomes invalid if the
information is altered without being resigned.

A single license in the file has the format

::

   LICENSE anybodytch ams4_trial 
       <MAINTENANCE_END> <LICENSE_END> <NUM_LICENSES>
       hostid=<HOST-ID> issuer=ABT     
       customer="<CUSTOMER_NAME>" issued=6-may-2009 sig="<SIGNATURE>"

When the license file is imported, it is copied and renamed to a special
location where AnyBody will look for it. The imported file is always
renamed to license.lic and previously imported files are renamed before
overwriting them. This means that old license files remain in the system
and can be located.

AnyBody will look for the license file in three locations in the
following order.

#. In the directory of AnyBody executables. This location is not used
   for imported licenses; it is merely searched for trouble shooting
   purposes.

#. Licenses imported for your personal user are located in a
   user-specific application data folder, typically:

   .. code-block::
      
      C:\Users\<UserName>AppData\Local\AnyBodyTechnology\AnyBody.7.x.x

#. Licenses imported for all users are located in a common application
   data folder, typically:

   .. code-block::
      
      C:\ProgramData\AnyBodyTechnology\AnyBody.7.x.x


Trouble-shooting the License
----------------------------

In case of a license problem, you can inspect the license status from
the License Manager dialog:

#. Open the License Manager from the Help->Registration menu. (It opens
   automatically if your license is not valid).

#. Press the button "View license status". It will open a dialog with
   license status information.

#. If needed, send the information to AnyBody support at
   support@anybodytech.com along with the license file..

Below is a list of typical license errors and causes:

*  License Status: "Bad signature in license (-5)"
      The license file has been violated, e.g. manually edited, and is
      no longer valid. A new license file is required.

*  License Status: "No license check or No authorization for product or
   License server doesn’t support this. Make sure you have imported a
   valid license file."

   #. No valid license file has been imported on the AnyBody client
      computer.

   #. The product name for the license is wrong. A new license file is
      required.

   #. No license file has been imported in the client computers.
       Please refer to chapter 4 of this guide.

*  License Status: "All licenses in use (-22)"
      Too many license instances have been checked out. Each instance of
      AnyBody count as one license check-out, even two instances on the
      same computer. This is related to counted licenses only.

*  License Status: "Wrong host for license (-4)"

   #. The license file is used by the wrong host, i.e., on the wrong
      computer.

   #. License is linked to a hardware dongle, which is missing or not
      accepted on the computer (drivers missing).

   #. Wrong dongle is used.

*  License Status: "Communication with server failed! Please make sure
   the server has been started."

   *  Wrong server hostname specified in the client license file. This
      can be changed without violating the license file signature.

   *  Different TCP/IP port number specified for license server and in
      client license file. The port number can be modified in the
      license file without violating its signature. Notice that from RLM
      v6, the default port is 5053 instead of 28000.

   *  Network issues. Make sure the client can contact the server
      properly. It may be necessary to set up firewall exceptions on the
      server and/or the client computer.

   *  License server is not accepting your license. There are three
      typical reasons for this, please refer to Section
      `4.1 <#Trouble-shooting the License Server Setup>`__:

      #. License server is not started.

      #. The license file is missing on the server.

      #. The AnyBody Technology definition file (a file identifying
         AnyBody Technology to the generic RLM server software) is
         missing in the license server setup.

.. _chapter:NetworkLicense:

Floating Licenses and License Management Server
===============================================

The AnyBody Modeling System uses the RLM license manager solution from
`Reprise Software, Inc <http://www.reprisesoftware.com>`__. This section describes the basics of a floating license setup with RLM,
including:

-  A typical (recommended) setup.

-  How to download the requisites.

-  How to get more information about RLM.

.. seealso:: For extended end-user information about RLM, please refer to the
   following resources: 
    
   * RLM support and download area http://www.reprisesoftware.com/support/end-users.php ,
   * RLM End-User Manual http://www.reprisesoftware.com/RLM_Enduser.html , 
   * RLM Online FAQ http://www.reprisesoftware.com/support/faq.php

Requirements
-----------------------

In order to set up your RLM license server for AnyBody license
management, you need the following:

#. A valid license file.

#. The RLM server executable and utilities for your server platform.

#. A file identifying AnyBody Technology for the RLM license server.
   This is referred to as an ISV definition file. This can be a platform
   independent server settings file (called anybodytch.set) or an
   executable (e.g. anybodytch.exe) for your specific server platform.

Item 2 and 3 you can download from
`www.anybodytech.com/download.html?did=license_server <http://www.anybodytech.com/download.html?did=license_server>`__.
You must log onto the AnyBody Technology website to get to the download
area. Reprise Software may deliver more and newer RML distributions than
currently supported by AnyBody Technology. These can be downloaded from
the Reprise Sofware website.

The license file is a text file (`*.lic`\ ), similar to the node-locked
license files described in the previous sections. The difference is that
the license file for a floating license server contains some additional
lines defining the server. This includes the server’s name, host-id, and
optionally a TCP/IP port number.

.. note:: You must send your server host-id to AnyBody Technology before
   the license file can be issued. The host-id is typically the MAC number
   of the primary ethernet card.

.. note:: If you need to run the RLM license server on a virtual machine
   you will have to contact AnyBody Technology, as this requires a special
   license file setup. In this case you will need to send the host-name of
   the virtual machine as well as the host-id (MAC address) of the virtual
   machine to AnyBody Technology.


A typical license server setup
------------------------------

A typical license server installation include:

#. Install the RLM license server executable, i.e., unpack it in your
   choice of directory on your server (If you already have an RLM
   license server running, you can use this one).

#. Copy the ISV definition file to the same directory (This is the
   typical and recommended setup, but the file can be located in another
   directory. Please refer to the RLM End-User Manual for more details)

#. Copy your license file to the same directory (This is the typical and
   recommended setup, but the file can be located in another directory.
   Please refer to the RLM End-User Manual for more details)

#. Check and if needed modify the hostname and TCP/IP port number in the
   first line (The HOST line) of the license file. The hostname and port
   number can be changed without invalidating the license file. On a
   Windows-based server, the hostname can be found by using the command
   "ipconfig /all" in a command prompt.

   -  The host name is the first argument of the HOST line.

   -  The TCP/IP port number is the third argument in the HOST line. It
      may be omitted in which case the default port is 5053 (Notice that
      RLM version 5 and older used 28000).

   -  The second argument is the host-id. This must not be changed or
      the license file becomes invalid.

#. If the client computer will be contacting the server through a VPN
   connection, it might be advantageous to set up the RLM license server
   to free licenses after the client computers have lost VPN contact
   with the license server computer. This can be done by creating an
   empty "anybodytch.opt" file in the same folder as the RLM executable
   on the license server computer. The anybodytch.opt file must contain
   the following line:

   ::

      TIMEOUT 3600

   This will free licenses used by remote client computers which have
   been out of contact with the license server computer for more than an
   hour.

#. Modify the firewall of the server to allow incoming connections on
   the ports used by RLM.

   -  On a Windows license server, the rlm.exe license server program
      can be added to the firewall exceptions. This should allow
      connections on the ports used by both RLM itself and the ISV
      license server started by RLM.

   -  On a license server with a port number based firewall, it may be
      necessary to add both RLM’s own port number (by default 5053 on
      RLM v6 and later), and the port number of the RLM AnyBody ISV
      license server to the firewall port exceptions. The AnyBody ISV
      license server can be set to use a specific port number by
      specifying it in the ISV line of the server license file. For
      further details on how to specify this, please refer to the RLM
      End-User Manual.

#. Start up the license server. The license server can either be started
   as a normal program or as a service.

   -  To start the RLM license server as a normal program, navigate to
      the RLM license server folder and start the RLM license server by
      executing rlm.exe. Please note that in this case the license
      server will only be serving licenses while this program is
      running.

   -  If the RLM license server is installed as a service, the RLM
      license server will automatically begin serving licenses when the
      server computer is started. To install the RLM license server as a
      service on a Windows server computer, please do the following:

      -  Open a command prompt with administrator privileges
         (right-click the command-prompt icon and select "Run as
         administrator").

      -  Execute the following command in the command prompt:

         .. code-block::

            C:\rlm\rlm.exe -install_service -dlog <rlm.exe location>\<logfilename> 
              -c <location of license file>\<license file name>
                
         Where the parts in ``<...>`` are replaced by the actual values
         for the specific server computer. An example of this could be:

         .. code-block::

            C:\rlm\rlm.exe -install_service -dlog c:\rlm\my_rlm_logfile.log 
              -c c:\rlm\license.lic              

      -  Start the rlm service by manually going to the Windows
         Services, finding the new RLM service, selecting it and
         starting it, or by rebooting the license server computer.

      The RLM license server can also be started as a service on Unix
      systems. For more details, please refer to the RLM End-User
      Manual.

#. Set up your client computers

   -  Install AnyBody as described in the previous sections.

   -  Import the license file. The same file as on the license server
      can be used, but in principle it only needs the first line; only
      server host-name and port number is needed.

.. _Trouble-shooting the License Server Setup:

Trouble-shooting the License Server Setup
-----------------------------------------

Below is a list of typical issues associated with setting up the license
server.

#. License server is not started.

#. The license file is missing on the server.

#. The AnyBody Technology definition file (anybodytch.set or
   anybodytch.exe) is missing in the license server setup.

#. Client and server does not communicate on the same port, either
   because different ports numbers are specified in the server and
   client side license files or because the default port number is used
   and different versions of RLM technology uses different ports.

-  An RLM option file is available for enabling logging of issues
   regarding the license server. A log file of this kind is needed when
   contacting AnyBody Support about license server related issues.

   The typical and recommended setup is to create a file called
   ’anybodytch.opt’ in the RLM license executable folder, if it does not
   already exist. The file must contain the following line:

   ::

      REPORTLOG + anybodytch1.log std

   Place the option file in the same directory as the license file that
   is read by the license server. Restarting the license server, a log
   file with the specified name will be created and updated during the
   license service.

   Please refer to the RLM End-User Manual, Chapters ’The License File’
   and ’The ISV option file’, for more details.

-  The status of the RLM license server on the license server computer
   can be viewed by running the following command in a command prompt in
   the license server computer RLM executable folder:

   ::

      rlmutil rlmstat -a

   The output from this command will provide information on what ports
   RLM is using, what ISV license servers are running, and what licenses
   are being served and used. If you need to contact AnyBody support
   regarding a floating license issues, please include the output from
   this command.

-  The connection between an RLM server and a client computer can be
   tested in the following way.

   -  Unpack the RLM installation package to a folder on the client
      computer to be tested.

   -  First, on the license server computer, run the following command
      line in the RLM license server executable folder:

      ::

         rlmtests -s

   -  Second, on the client computer, run the following command line in
      the folder where you unpacked the RLM installation package (with
      <server hostname> replaced by the actual RLM license server
      computer hostname):

      ::

         rlmtests -a <server hostname>

   -  The client computer will now begin trying to contact the RLM
      license server computer, and the output in the client computers
      command prompt will display whether the tests are successful.
