<p>The AnyBody Exporter™ for SOLIDWORKS® Translator (AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS™) is
an add-in for SOLIDWORKS that can translate a SOLIDWORKS CAD assembly
into its corresponding AnyScript model, which can then be used in the
AnyBody Modeling System. This allows users to design environments for
the human body in the state-of-the-art design environment of SOLIDWORKS
and it is also possible to use AnyBody to analyze and optimize products
developed in SOLIDWORKS, either in terms of their interaction with the
human body or in terms of their stand-alone function. Typical
applications would be medical devices, tools, sports equipment,
workplaces and furniture.</p>
<p>The AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS application translates SOLIDWORKS assemblies into
AnyBody models as fast and accurately as possible, preserving
constraints between the parts as well as their visual appearance. The
result is a functional model in AnyBody, which can analyze movements and
forces in the product either alone or in connection with a
musculoskeletal model.</p>

<p>We imagine that an assembly of an exercise machine has been created in
SOLIDWORKS as shown in the figure below. An assembly in SOLIDWORKS is a
set of parts connected by mates, which are really kinematic constraints
that, for instance, keep a shaft in a bearing or make two faces
parallel. This forms a mechanism. The translation process generates an
AnyBody segment from each of the parts and connects the segments with
joints corresponding to the mates. To carry out the translation, please
perform the following steps.</p>

<h3>Opening the translated model in AnyBody<a class="headerlink" href="#opening-the-translated-model-in-anybody" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The structure of the model is one main AnyScript file and a number of
AnyScript files containing the actual model. In addition, STL files
corresponding to the various parts are also generated. The main file is
called <code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><em><span class="pre">YourModelName</span></em><span class="pre">.main.any</span></code>, if you open and load the main file in
the AnyBody Modeling System, a model visually very similar to the
SOLIDWORKS model you exported should appear.</p>
<p>However, the main file contains very little code and is actually just a
reference to the principal export file called <code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><em><span class="pre">YourModelName</span></em><span class="pre">.any</span></code>. The
latter contains the actual model but is intended to be used as one
element in a model also including, for instance, the human model. The
advantage of this setup is that it is easy to develop an AnyBody model
originating in the main file while working with the SOLIDWORKS model and
updating it with repeated exports. Every time the model is exported from
SOLIDWORKS, the exported files are overwritten, so please remember to
make your own copy of the main file before you start developing it in
AnyBody. This will prevent you from accidentally losing your work.
Please notice also that the naming of elements in the AnyScript files
depends on the naming of the components in the SOLIDWORKS model. So
references to the SOLIDWORKS-generated parts of the model may need to be
updated if the SOLIDWORKS model has been changed.</p>

<h3>Making a simple AnyBody analysis of the model<a class="headerlink" href="#making-a-simple-anybody-analysis-of-the-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For the inverse dynamics analysis or kinematic analysis in AnyBody
Modeling System, the number of all kinematic constraints (from joints,
drivers and general constraints) should in principle be as same as the
number of degrees of freedom. A model imported from SOLIDWORKS will
usually be lacking a few drivers to determine the motion of the model’s
natural degrees-of-freedom like, for instance, the rotation of the
flywheel in the exercise machine example shown in the figure. So in
general, you must add some “drivers” to define your own motion for the
model. Before adding the human model to your assembly model, it is
recommended that you define a set of simple drivers in your model to
test whether it works well or not. This set of kinematic driver
constraints must match the degrees of freedom free for motion in your
CAD assembly model.</p>

<h3>Adding the human to the model<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-the-human-to-the-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When you want to define the kinematic connections (constraints) between
human and assembly models, it is highly recommended that you define some
‘Reference Coordinate System’ objects inside your SOLIDWORKS assembly
model. These should be defined at the positions where your SOLIDWORKS
model should be connected to the AnyBody human model, and they will be
converted into ‘AnyRefNode’ objects, which is the AnyScript equivalent,
by the translator. In order to enable easy access to these resulting
AnyRefNodes, the translator implements a feature that looks for objects
with a specific naming prefix (by default the prefix is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ANY_</span></code>, but this
can be changed in the translation options). The objects with names
matching this prefix will be made available in a special folder (called
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_ANY_INTERFACE_</span></code>) found at the top level of the exported assembly for
easy access. In addition, you should define similar objects
(‘AnyRefNode’ objects) inside the AnyBody human model segments at the
locations where you want the contact to occur, such as the hands, feet,
pelvis and thorax. An example of how this is done can also be found in

<div class="section" id="redundant-mates-in-solidworks-models">
<h3>Redundant mates in SOLIDWORKS models<a class="headerlink" href="#redundant-mates-in-solidworks-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Redundancy of kinematic constraints is a general issue in all rigid body
mechanical modeling, whether you work with AnyBody alone, SOLIDWORKS
alone, or in this case a combination of SOLIDWORKS and AnyBody. Unlike
AnyBody, SOLIDWORKS is not a kinetic mechanism analysis system per se.
This means that SOLIDWORKS can be more forgiving in terms of redundancy
of constraints than AnyBody is.</p>
<p>Redundant constraints are kinematic constraints (i.e. the equations
governing the motion, i.e. equations associated with the mates) that are
not independent, i.e., one or more kinematic equations describe the same
motion. Such equations may prescribe the same motion, i.e., some of them
are redundant, and they may, due to small numerical differences in the
model, be slightly contradictory, so the full set of kinematic equations
cannot be solved. In this case the model is kinematically
over-determinate.</p>
<p>In pure kinematic analysis, redundant constraints can be handled by
solvers that allow small violations of constraints, and AnyBody as well
as SOLIDWORKS has this functionality. But in dynamic (kinetic) analysis,
redundant kinematic constraints will create a statically indeterminate
system to which there is physically reasonable solution. This implies
that the reaction forces arising from the redundant constraints (mates)
are not well-defined. In mechanical design in general, such redundant
constraints can create problems with tolerances, locking, increased
wear, temperature sensitivity, chaotic vibrations and other undesirable
behaviors, so they represent poor engineering also in material products.
<strong>Therefore, it is always advisable to avoid redundant kinematic
constraints!</strong></p>
<p>SOLIDWORKS deals well with kinematic redundancy in solving the
kinematics. And for this reason, it is very typical to create mate
combinations in SOLIDWORKS models that introduce such redundant
kinematic constraints without ever experiencing any problems.</p>
<p>There are typically two ways redundant constraints appear in your model:
One is simple over constraining of a single joint between two parts by
using two or more mates that actually specifies the same conditions, at
least partially. The second one is when closing mechanical loops, where
the closing conditions are can be too many or only possible to fulfill
under certain conditions. For instance, a planar four-bar linkage with
four hinge joints actually has less than zero degrees of freedom and it
can only move due to the fact that it is planar and that all the hinge
joints have parallel axes.</p>
<p>AnyBody can also handle some level of kinematic redundancy in the
kinematic analysis, but when adding the human to an already redundant
kinematic model, it may lead to failure of the kinematic analysis.
Moreover, dynamic analysis, which is the obvious target of translating a
model to AnyBody, will accept the redundancy, but not necessarily in a
meaningful way; among the infinitely many solutions for the redundant
reaction forces one will be picked more or less randomly in each time
step, and forces in the model will typically fluctuate.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is recommended to avoid redundancy in the mate
configuration for your SOLIDWORKS model, in particular if it is to be
used for dynamical analysis. It is usually easier to fix the problem in
SOLIDWORKS before exporting the model.</p>
<p>In some cases, such as if the (redundant) reaction forces “inside the
machine” are of no direct interest to you, redundancy may be acceptable
in your model, since it may not affect the results important for you.
However, one way to check this is to remove the redundancy, so again it
is advisable to avoid redundant constraints entirely.</p>
<p>The next section shows how to make typical mechanical joints minimizing
the risk of introducing redundancy issues using standard SOLIDWORKS
mates and combinations hereof. Please notice that this approach may
still introduce redundancy of the type related to closed kinematic loop
configurations.</p>
<p>How to deal with redundancy is discussed in more details and
demonstrated in <a class="reference external" href="../Tutorials/AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS/lesson2.html" title="(in AnyBody Tutorials v7.3)"><span class="xref std std-doc">lesson 2 of the “Making Models using SOLIDWORKS” tutorial.</span></a></p>

<h3>How to make good mate definitions according to your purpose<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-make-good-mate-definitions-according-to-your-purpose" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The table below shows how to use standard SOLIDWORKS mates to make
typical mechanical joints of AnyBody without introducing redundant
constraints; and thereby keep the number of constraints as low as
possible. It is recommended to follow these guidelines when building
your SOLIDWORKS model, or when preparing an existing model for
translation.</p>
<p>Please notice that this approach may not prevent redundancy related to
closed kinematical loop configurations.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with AnyScript, then there are several ways to make

<h2>Concepts of Translation<a class="headerlink" href="#concepts-of-translation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this section, an overview of the translator functionality is given.
The basic concepts are described, followed by overview tables of the
translator’s capabilities.</p>
<p>Every SOLIDWORKS assembly model may comprise several parts, mates, and
sub-assemblies. All information about an assembly is organized in the
Feature Tree of SOLIDWORKS. The basic concept of AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS is to
translate the tree structure of an assembly as directly as possible, so
that all information can be found in same location in the associated
tree-structure in AnyBody.</p>
<p>SOLIDWORKS features are generally translated as follows</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A SOLIDWORKS assembly is translated to an AnyFolder object in
AnyScript. Each assembly will produce its own AnyScript file and the
files of super-assemblies will include sub-assemblies.</p></li>
<li><p>A SOLIDWORKS part is translated to an <a class="reference external" href="../AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnySeg.html#anyseg" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnySeg</span></a> object in AnyScript.
Each part will have an associated STL file capturing the geometric
appearance of the part in the SOLIDWORKS model.</p></li>
<li><p>A SOLIDWORKS mate is translated to a combination of several
constraints in AnyBody. (Mechanical mates are translated into the
corresponding standard joints in AnyBody)</p></li>
<li><p>A SOLIDWORKS reference geometry object such as point, axis, plane and
coordinate system will be translated to an <a class="reference external" href="../AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyRefNode.html#anyrefnode" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyRefNode</span></a> object and will
be located in corresponding <a class="reference external" href="../AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnySeg.html#anyseg" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnySeg</span></a> objects.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All assemblies are converted into <a class="reference external" href="../AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyFolder.html#anyfolder" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyFolder</span></a>s, which are the AnyScript
structures for holding other objects. But in order to handle the
position of the assembly (i.e. the Origin), a reference frame, also
called Origin, is added to the assembly folder in the AnyBody model. For
the top assembly, this reference frame is fixed, whereas all
sub-assemblies have a movable Origin. The movable Origins are defined as
‘dummy’ segments, i.e. an <a class="reference external" href="../AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnySeg.html#anyseg" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnySeg</span></a> with zero mass, in the AnyBody model.
All user-defined reference frames of the assemblies and any other
components are added as so-called nodes (class <a class="reference external" href="../AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyRefNode.html#anyrefnode" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyRefNode</span></a>) on fixed or
movable assembly reference frames in the AnyBody model.</p>
<p>All parts are converted into <a class="reference external" href="../AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnySeg.html#anyseg" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnySeg</span></a> objects and each of these <a class="reference external" href="../AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnySeg.html#anyseg" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnySeg</span></a>
object replicates the initial position and rotation at the time of
translation, mass, moments of inertia, and color. Furthermore, the
reference point, reference axis, reference plane and all reference
coordinate system objects, which are defined in that part, will be also
translated into that <a class="reference external" href="../AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnySeg.html#anyseg" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnySeg</span></a> object. As mentioned the graphical
appearance is captured by the translator exporting STL files for each
part. In AnyScript, these are entered with colors matching as well as
possible the color in SOLIDWORKS.</p>
<p>Regarding kinematics, all mates in SOLIDWORKS can be considered as
kinematic constraints. So all the mates in the assembly are translated
into similar (several, if needed) kinematic constraints as they can be
implemented by AnyScript. AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS can translate almost all of
standard mates of SOLIDWORKS into equivalent AnyBody kinematic
constraints; however only a subset of the more advanced mates are
covered. In particular, mates related to general surfaces and curves are
not handled by the translator. Mate types that are not handled by the
converter is simply skipped during the translation process, allowing you
to use the remaining part of the model; in some cases the allows you to
handle the missing constraints manually in AnyBody.</p>
<p>AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS adds a few elements to the model structure. These will
appear in the AnyBody Model tree and the will be named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_ANY_&lt;NAME&gt;_</span></code>,
where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;NAME&gt;</span></code> is the name of the element. The following list covers the
important elements that must be mentioned:</p>

</table>
<p>The GEAR, SCREW, UNIVERSAL, RACK PINION mates are, as indicated in the
table, not covered by the translator itself; however, the kinematic
constraints associated with such connections are not difficult to
realize in AnyBody. They can be implemented in AnyScript using standard
kinematic constraints. The CAM mate, on the contrary, is typically not
realizable, at least not in a simple way, because the limited capability
of handling surfaces in the kinematic engine of AnyBody.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it can be noticed that some SOLIDWORKS mates inherently
contain the possibility for singular positions. Such singularities arise
when the mathematical equations degenerate under certain conditions.
Like a distance constraint, i.e. a single constraints, but if the wanted
distance is zero, it is suddenly something else; a spherical constraint,
i.e. three constraints, is needed to handle this. Conditions for such
singularities may arise during as motion and close to the singularities
the kinematic equations may be poorly conditioned and difficult to solve
accurately and can be the source of translated models that perform
poorly when motion is applied.</p>

<h3>Some exceptions<a class="headerlink" href="#some-exceptions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="section" id="suppressed-and-inactive-components-mates-and-features">
<h4>Suppressed and inactive components, mates and features<a class="headerlink" href="#suppressed-and-inactive-components-mates-and-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In SOLIDWORKS, you can suppress some components, mates and other
features as you want. And some of these objects may become inactive due
to the relationships with other objects in the model even they are not
suppressed by users manually. Then all of these suppressed or inactive
objects will be displayed in gray color at the feature tree.
AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS tries to detect these suppressed or inactive objects
and those will not be translated. Instead, if AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS can
detect these things, then some warning messages will be written in the
log file which will be created in the same folder where the resultant
AnyScript files are located.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="center-of-mass-reference-geometry">
<h4>Center of Mass reference geometry<a class="headerlink" href="#center-of-mass-reference-geometry" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A new reference geometry type ‘Center of Mass’ has been introduced since
SOLIDWORKS 2013 version. This object in the feature tree will not be
translated into the resultant AnyScript files. So whenever
AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS detects these Center of Mass objects in the feature
tree then a warning message will be written in the log file.</p>
<p>But there are easy alternative ways to create your own center of mass
objects using AnyScript. For assemblies, you can use an <a class="reference external" href="../AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyKinCoM.html#anykincom" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyKinCoM</span></a> class
object to create the center of mass from several different parts. For
parts, you can just create an extra <a class="reference external" href="../AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyRefNode.html#anyrefnode" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyRefNode</span></a> class object using the
<a class="reference external" href="../AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnySeg.html#anyseg-scom" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span class="xref std std-ref">sCoM</span></a> value of the <a class="reference external" href="../AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnySeg.html#anyseg" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnySeg</span></a> object.</p>
<p>If your SOLIDWORKS model contains any Center of Mass objects in the
assemblies and if these are used for any mates, then those mates will
not work properly in AnyBody. That’s because the Center of Mass in the
assemblies are moving points so those are not fixed in the assembly
coordinate system. But currently AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS assumes that all the
mates are defined using some fixed reference geometries in either
assemblies or parts. So if you find that some of those mates are
translated into your AnyScript files, then it will be better to delete
them in the AnyScript files and create your own constraints manually
using AnyScript.</p>
