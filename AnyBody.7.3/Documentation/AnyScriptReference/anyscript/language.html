<span id="language-intro"></span><h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>AnyScript™ is an object-oriented language with a fixed set of available data
types (classes). This means that you cannot define your own types and you
cannot, like in a programming language, write algorithms. An AnyScript™ file is
purely consisting of definitions (declarations) of objects and the internal data
structure in AnyBody maps these definitions completely.</p>
<p>The following sections gives a brief introduction to the rules for writing an
AnyScript™ file or files. In many ways AnyScript™ looks syntactically like C++ or Java and
this is a deliberate choice.</p>
<p>In fact, if you compare AnyScript™ to popular programming languages, you may find
that it is very similar to JavaScript. The syntax is much the same, and
AnyScript™ shares the property with (the first versions of) JavaScript that it works on a set of
predefined classes and does not let the user define new classes. Some of
the syntactic similarities are the use of braces to delimit different
sections of the model from each other and the fact that each declaration
is terminated by a semicolon. The main difference is that AnyScript™ does not
contain any executable statements, so you cannot specify a sequence of
events, i.e., write algorithms; AnyScript™ is purely declarative contrary to C++ and Java.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-main-folder-and-scopes">
<h2>The Main folder and scopes<a class="headerlink" href="#the-main-folder-and-scopes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As we have already mentioned briefly, the Main folder plays a special
role as a container of the entire model. This means that a basic AnyScript™ file
must contain a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Main</span> <span class="pre">=</span></code> statement:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Main</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
 <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">model</span> <span class="n">content</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You could define all the objects of the model in one big pile inside the Main folder. This
would create a very flat but also disorganized object tree. So users
normally prefer to organize the objects of the model in subfolders
according to some system.</p>
<p>For instance, a folder could contain objects
of similar types, or it could be a particular body part. The folder
structure plays an important role for complex models of the entire body.
It allows such models with many hundred element to be composed of
body part models developed by different users. AnyFolder can be nested as
much as you find practical for your model; AnyScript™ does not make any
restrictions in this regard.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>All statements in AnyScript™ end by a semicolon. We have this in
containing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Main</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">{</span> <span class="pre">&lt;model</span> <span class="pre">content&gt;</span> <span class="pre">};</span></code> statement and this is how all statements must end.</p>
</div>
<p>It is also possible to include Main files from other files.
In principle, this function is just like any other <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#include</span></code>-statement.
However, in this situation the Main folder is considered a globally defined folder.
Which implies that regardless of the scope in which this folder is opened,
all additions to the folder will go to the top level folder. So wherever you include a Main file,
the same thing happens, namely that you add all what is declared in the
included Main file to your current model’s Main scope. This can indeed
be confusing and takes some level of experience to master.
It is not recommended to include other Main file from
various arbitrary files in your model. Do it from the top level if
needed, so that it is as transparent from the code as possible.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The Main file can only be included once; already at the
second attempt all member declared in the included Main file will
conflict with already existig object from the first inclusion.</p>
</div>
<p>There is one nice application where it may be commendable to
include a Main file from another Main file. This is if you are making
extensions to an existing model, but you would like these extensions to
stay separated from the existing code. For instance, you may be adding
test facilities you only need temporarily or once in a while, and you do
not want these facilites to influence the appearance of the model, which
you may share with your coworkers. In this case you can make new Main
file, include your common Main file, and then create your additions in the new
file.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can also use this functionality to combine two models, if
they are properly designed for coexistence inside the Main scope. For
this case however, it may be advisable to design the models each as separate
building blocks (i.e. non-Main include files).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="declarations">
<h2>Declarations<a class="headerlink" href="#declarations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A declaration of an object is made by writing the class name followed by
the name you want for the object.</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ClassName</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">objectname</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The object name can consist of letters (case sensitive), digits (not as the first
character) and underscores. The declaration defines (creates) a new object
that did not exist before, i.e., a new instance of the class. The object
declaration must also contain an initialization of the object’s value.
This is done by an equality sign followed by an acceptable value for the
given class. For folders, the &lt;value&gt; can be a scope
containing multiple statements inside braces. As for value-objects, it can
be simple values or expressions.</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">AnyFolder</span> <span class="n">MyFolder</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{};</span> <span class="c1">//Empty folder</span>
<span class="kt">AnyVar</span> <span class="n">MyVal</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">1.0</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="initializing-objects">
<h2>Initializing objects<a class="headerlink" href="#initializing-objects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some objects are not declared directly in the script; they come into the
model as predefined members of others, their owner. Most folder classes
(except for <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyFolder.html#anyfolder"><span class="std std-ref">AnyFolder</span></a> and some other basic classes) have such predefined
members, which are implicitly declared when you declare the owner.</p>
<p>Some predefined object members can or need to be
initialized with a statement similar to the declaration; in this case
you should simply omit the class name, because the object already
exists, i.e.:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="s">&quot;&lt;objectname&gt; = &lt;value&gt;;&quot;</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>All objects that hold values (<a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyValue.html#anyvalue"><span class="std std-ref">AnyValue</span></a>-derived) can only be initialized once
from the script. Folders, however, can be initialized many times, because
initializing the folder is actually the same as opening its scope and adding
to it.</p>
<p>The folder initialization looks like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">foldername</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">content</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">};</span><span class="s">&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Actually, the start of the AnyScript™ file, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Main</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">{</span></code>, can
be regarded as merely an initialization of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Main</span></code> folder.</p>
</div>
<p>Multiple initializations of a folder allow you to add contents to folder
from many places in your script. This is a very important feature when
creating complex models that are composed of many building blocks</p>
<p>The sequence of declarations of objects in AnyScript™ does in general not
matter. This can be allowed due to the fact that you only declare
objects, i.e., state the existence of them; you do not define sequences
of events like in most programming languages. AnyScript™ will look for objects in
the entire object tree if you refer to a existing object. This implies
that you can declare an object in the bottom of your file and refer to
it in the top.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Some classes do however use the sequence of its members
to determine certain properties that may be use in subsequent
computations.</p>
<p>In such case, it is advisable to declare such sequence sensitive members
inside a single folder initialization scope because the sequence of the
members then becomes the same as the sequence in the code.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="references-and-expressions">
<span id="section-syntax-references-and-expressions"></span><h2>References and Expressions<a class="headerlink" href="#references-and-expressions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can refer to objects by their names. Inside the scope of a given
folder, the members’ names are unique, i.e., no two objects can have the
same name.</p>
<p>You can also refer to objects that are located in other
folders. This can be accomplished in two ways: by absolute and by
relative references.</p>
<dl id="syntax-absolute-ref">
<dt>Absolute references</dt><dd><p>Absolute references are made by the so-called complete name of an
object. The complete name specifies all owners from the root, i.e. from
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Main</span></code>, and to the object like for instance:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Main</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">foldername</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">subfoldername</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">objectname</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This absolute reference to an object is valid from any scope in model.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="syntax-relative-ref">
<dt>Relative references</dt><dd><p>A relative reference is however only valid from that particular scope
level. You can refer further down in the object tree from a given level
like the absolute reference refers down from the Global scope, for
instance <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;membername&gt;.&lt;sub-member&gt;.&lt;objectname&gt;</span></code>.</p>
<p>You can also
refer up the model tree. A dot in front of the name indicates one level
up the tree, i.e., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">...&lt;foldername&gt;.&lt;objectname&gt;</span></code>  refers to the member
of a folder three levels up from the current scope.</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">AnyFolder</span> <span class="n">Folder</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">AnyVar</span> <span class="n">B</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="kt">AnyFolder</span> <span class="n">Folder2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">AnyFolder</span> <span class="n">Subfolder1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c1">// A is assined the value of B.</span>
        <span class="c1">// Use two dots to go up two scopes when refering to B</span>
        <span class="kt">AnyVar</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">..</span><span class="n">Folder1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">B</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Use two dot</span>
    <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Absolute and relative references can be used on the left hand side of
the equality sign in an initialization; however, the more common use is
on the right hand side for specification of the value.</p>
<p>All value objects
(derived from <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyValue.html#anyvalue"><span class="std std-ref">AnyValue</span></a>) can be initialized as equal to another value of
the same type.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-reference-operator">
<h3>The reference <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&amp;</span></code> operator<a class="headerlink" href="#the-reference-operator" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Folders cannot be initialized with another object. So you cannot copy everything
from one folder to another by initializing one folder by another.</p>
<p>However, you can create special referencing objects that refer to an existing folder
(this is much like references in C++).</p>
<p>Such references are made by objects of the class <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyRefObject.html#anyrefobject"><span class="std std-ref">AnyRefObject</span></a>, but they
are not declared in the script by this class name; they are declared by a class name of the
object you want to refer to and the so-called reference operator (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&amp;</span></code>,
like in C++).</p>
<p>A reference object declaration looks like:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Target</span> <span class="n">Class</span> <span class="n">Name</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&amp;&lt;</span><span class="n">ref</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">target</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;target</span> <span class="pre">name&gt;</span></code> is a folder object specified by either
<a class="reference internal" href="#syntax-absolute-ref"><span class="std std-ref">absolute</span></a> or
<a class="reference internal" href="#syntax-relative-ref"><span class="std std-ref">relative referencing</span></a>.</p>
<p>What can the reference objects (or in short ’references’) be used
for? Actually, they are a very important and powerful feature of AnyScript™. Many
objects use other objects of particular classes, which they expect
the user to declare as members. For instance many mechanical objects need
their attachment points to be defined by declarations of reference
frames inside the mechanical object. Often these points are already
existing in other places in the model and here it is possible to simply
make a reference object pointing to the real object. The real object
exists only once, but through the reference object it appears to exist
in two places. It cannot be emphasized enough that there is only one
object and when its properties are changed, the changes will appear in
the all places including the references.</p>
<p>As stated above, a reference object is declared by
the class name of the target object and the reference operator. However,
the class specification does not have to be an exact match of the target
object’s type. Any parent class of the target object is valid as
reference type specification. It can be advantageous not to use exact
class matches for reference and target, especially if you tend to change the
class of the target or change the target to another object of another
class. If all your possible target classes have a common base, this base
class may be a more practical choice for type definition of your
reference. There may however be restrictions on how general a base class
you can choose, this depends on the function the reference object has.</p>
<p>If you make a reference specified as an <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyObject.html#anyobject"><span class="std std-ref">AnyObject</span></a>, AnyScript™ can not resolve
whether it is folder class, a value class, or some much more specific
class. This means that you lose the information about the special
features of a class, if you refer to it with a parent class as class
specifier.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mathematical-expression-and-operators">
<h2>Mathematical expression and operators<a class="headerlink" href="#mathematical-expression-and-operators" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section  contains the descriptions of the value classes of AnyScript and the
expressions that are possible on these classes. The value classes are
derived from the class <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyValue.html#anyvalue"><span class="std std-ref">AnyValue</span></a>. They define the basic data types of AnyScript,
such as floating point numbers, integers, strings etc.</p>
<p>Values can be initialized by assignment statements, i.e., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;objectname&gt;</span>
<span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">&lt;value&gt;;</span></code>. Depending on the data type such assignments can contain
more or less complex expressions of other values in the model, i.e.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;objectname&gt;</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">&lt;expression&gt;;</span></code>. You cannot make references to <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyValue.html#anyvalue"><span class="std std-ref">AnyValue</span></a>s
as you can to <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyFolder.html#anyfolder"><span class="std std-ref">AnyFolder</span></a>s; expressions however provide a similar
functionality for linking values to each other. Expressions on these
values can be formed by means a standard set of mathematical operators
and functions.</p>
<p>Functions are, as other elements in AnyScript, implemented as classes (derived
from the base class <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyFunction.html#anyfunction"><span class="std std-ref">AnyFunction</span></a>). Such classes define a function, which
is an entity that delivers a certain output value given certain input in
a list of values (the argument list). For instance you will find the
standard trigonometric functions sine and cosine implemented in the
classes <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyFunSin.html#anyfunsin"><span class="std std-ref">AnyFunSin</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyFunCos.html#anyfuncos"><span class="std std-ref">AnyFunCos</span></a>.</p>
<p>When you apply a function in an expression, you use an object for the
given function class. Contrary to other objects, AnyScript accepts and require an
argument list in parentheses after function object names when it appears
in a right-hand side expression. The output value replaces the function
objects in the expression during the evaluation. For instance you use an
object called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sin</span></code>, which is of the class <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyFunSin.html#anyfunsin"><span class="std std-ref">AnyFunSin</span></a>, when you want to
get sine of a number. The function is evaluated whenever the expression,
of which it is part, is evaluated.</p>
<p>For standard functions, such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sin()</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cos()</span></code>, the system has
predefined objects with practical names placed in the Global scope.
Therefore, you do not need to make declarations of the objects before
using them in expressions. This makes standard functions available, as
one would expect, simply by typing the function name followed by the
argument list in parentheses. However, for other functions, typically
more complex ones with various options, you must declare the function
object manually similar to any other object in AnyScript. Hereafter the function
can be accessed using the name of the object with either absolute or
relative naming principles.</p>
<p>Functions can be polymorphic, which means that the a given function
class (<a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyFunction.html#anyfunction"><span class="std std-ref">AnyFunction</span></a>) can hold several actual functions that can be
distinguished from each other by their parameter list. They all share
the same function name, which is the name of the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyFunction.html#anyfunction"><span class="std std-ref">AnyFunction</span></a> object. The
actual functions are implemented in members of <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyFunction.html#anyfunction"><span class="std std-ref">AnyFunction</span></a> that are of
the type <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyMonoFunction.html#anymonofunction"><span class="std std-ref">AnyMonoFunction</span></a>. Multiple <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyMonoFunction.html#anymonofunction"><span class="std std-ref">AnyMonoFunction</span></a>s in an <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyFunction.html#anyfunction"><span class="std std-ref">AnyFunction</span></a>
provide polymorphism. From practical user point of view, these
“MonoFunctions” do not have any significance and they are typically
implemented as Hidden classes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="comments-and-model-documentation">
<h2>Comments and model documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#comments-and-model-documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To make your AnyScript™ file more legible you can benefit from making comments and
splitting your model into several files. Both can be realized by
features adopted from the C++ language.</p>
<p>Comments that are ignored by the AnyScript™ compiler can be made in two ways: An
entire paragraph can be excluded from the compilation by bounding it
with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/*</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*/</span></code>, and a single line can be excluded by a leading
double slash, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">//</span></code>. The comment functionality can be used not only to
write sensible messages to yourself or other readers of the code, but
also to exclude parts of the code temporarily during development and
testing of a model.</p>
<p>From version 2.0 of AnyBody, comments starting with either <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/**</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">///</span></code> have
been given a special meaning. These will be treated as part of a special
model documentation that is stored together with the model objects and
made available to the users of the models without requiring them to read
the AnyScript™ source code. From version 3.0, these comments are collected with
other object specific information to form an Object Description
function, which for instance can be accessed from all Model Trees in the
AnyBody GUI.</p>
<p>Comments using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/**</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">///</span></code> must be attached to an object in the
script code. This is done by placing the comment right in front the
initialization of the object. This is referred to as a prefixed
Documentation Comment. Documentation Comments can also be postfixed, i.e.
placed right after an object initialization, but this requires an
additional <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;</span></code> after the preceding mark, i.e., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">///&lt;</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/**&lt;</span></code>. This
is convenient when documenting “small” objects like variables and the
like.</p>
<p>A third method is convenient for “larger objects”, i.e. folders. Folders
can documented in the middle of the folder scope. We shall refer to this
as scope-fixed Documentation Comments. A scope-fixed Documentation
Comment is marked by adding an additional <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">^</span></code> after the preceding mark,
i.e., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">///^</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/**^</span></code>. This is convenient when documenting a section
of code in the scope of an object, for instance from the inside of an
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#include</span></code> file used during initialization of the object. Inside the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#include</span></code> file there will be no access to the start or end of the
object’s scope, but still the contents of the file may be worth
commenting on. This is particularly convenient if the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#include</span></code> file is
used multiple time from different objects in the model, in which case it
would require multiple identical Documentation Comments if they were
made outside the include file, in the vicinity of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#include</span></code>-statement.</p>
<p>Folders can be initialized several times and Documentation Comments can
be made for each initialization. Multiple such comments are collected
into one text, when presented in the AnyBody application. In the AnyBody
GUI such collected presentations of Documentation Comments typically
contains links to the code for each comments. This can be a powerful
tool for navigating the AnyScript™ code of “large” objects being initialized in
many places.</p>
