<h1>Inside the AnyBody Modeling System<a class="headerlink" href="#inside-the-anybody-modeling-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In this section, we shall attempt to describe the the way AnyBody, or rather
the AnyScript™ kernel of it, works. We shall do this in very general terms, which
means that we are not going into detail about particular operations of
particular classes. We shall focus on general functionalities and
properties of a model when it is loaded into AnyBody.</p>
<p>In order to cover these
issues, we shall firstly consider the loading process, i.e., the
processes that take place from initiating the loading of a model file
until it is completely loaded. Afterward, we shall generally consider
runtime processes. Runtime processes are evoked by executing operations
(<a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyOperation.html#anyoperation"><span class="std std-ref">AnyOperation</span></a> objects).</p>
<div class="section" id="the-loading-process">
<h2>The Loading process<a class="headerlink" href="#the-loading-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The loading process is described best by explaining the sequence of
procedure that take place. This is done in the list below.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Scanning</dt><dd><p>During the scanning the files are loaded into the computer’s memory. This
implies that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#include</span></code>-statements are resolved and the so-called file tree
is constructed. The preprocessor resolves all <a class="reference internal" href="preprocessor.html#preprocessor-include"><span class="std std-ref">#include</span></a> statements and other code-macros related to the
<a class="reference internal" href="preprocessor.html"><span class="doc">preprocessor</span></a>. The nature of the preprocessor is code
sequence dependent in contrast to normal behaviour in AnyScript™ code.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Parsing</dt><dd><p>The parser breaks the text input into pieces and during this stage the
syntax is checked. Basic syntactical errors are
reported during this stage. Furthermore, the parser establishes some
basic relations between the model in memory and the AnyScript™ code, which are
later used by the system to assist the user getting from the model
(in memory) to the code.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Constructing model tree</dt><dd><p>Having parsed the text input, the parser can construct the data
structures for the objects declared in the code. It hereby constructs
the basic model tree that you find available in the Model Tree View
in AnyBody’s GUI application. However, this is not the final complete tree,
as we shall see later. This stage also implies basic validation of
the data structure and related error reporting if necessary.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Linking identifiers</dt><dd><p>During this stage, values and references are linked together
according to the expressions in the code. This implies various checks
of the validity of the expressions such as check for existence of all
referred identifiers, cyclic referencing, type validation of
references.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Evaluating constants</dt><dd><p>Having linked and validated all expressions, the mathematical
expressions for values that are constant throughout the execution of
the model are evaluated. These values play a special role, because
they are input to the subsequent configuration stage. During this
evaluation, the expressions are also checked for dimensional
compatibility and the like, and <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyValue.html#anyvalue"><span class="std std-ref">AnyValue</span></a>s having undefined
dimensionality or dimension sizes are automatically set to fit the
expressions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Configuration</dt><dd><p>The configuration is a complex process, in which
the objects prepare themselves for performing their functionality.
This implies that certain objects, that collect and combine
information from many classes/object, for instance studies (<a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyStudy.html#anystudy"><span class="std std-ref">AnyStudy</span></a>
and derived), establish links to their dependencies and process their
information. This procedure relies on relationships between objects
(and their classes) and it is carried out in a well defined sequence.
If nothing else is implied for a given class there is assumed a
downwards relationship in the object tree, so that the configuration
of an object (folder objects only) may depend on its members. This is
however not sufficiently general and therefore special classes
(derived from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AnyConfigFolder</span></code> are able to state their own
dependencies and allow the configuration to treat them accordingly.
This do for instance imply that basic mechanical objects are
configured before the mechanical studies that use them.</p>
<p>Notice that the configuration sequence is not visible for the user.
Notice also that during the configuration, new objects can be created
into the object tree by existing objects. This has the special
significance that you may find objects in the object tree, which
cannot be referred to by references and in mathematical expressions
as these links are validated before the configuration step.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Evaluating model</dt><dd><p>After the configuration, the model is more or less ready. This means that
initial values of all non-<a class="reference internal" href="#insideams-evalmoments"><span class="std std-ref">const</span></a> AnyValues
can be set. This is done during the “Evaluating Model” stage. Notice that this
first evaluation, as for the constant values evaluated before the
configuration, implies a mathematical check of the expressions including
automatic definition of undefined dimensionalities and dimension sizes of
vectors, matrices and higher order tensors supported by the AnyValue types.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Post loading process</dt><dd><p>Finally a post process is carried out. This stage makes the final
preparation of the output data structures in the studies (<a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyStudy.html#anystudy"><span class="std std-ref">AnyStudy</span></a>’s Output
folder). This cannot take place before, because the
studies must be configured and all mathematical relations must be
ready before that output is well-defined. This has the important
implication that you cannot make mathematical expressions that
directly access data in the output data structures for the simple
reason that expressions are validated before the output exist. There
is an indirect workaround to this using the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyOutputFun.html#anyoutputfun"><span class="std std-ref">AnyOutputFun</span></a>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>After the loading process as described above is completed successfully,
the model is ready for execution of the operations it contains. We shall
refer to this as runtime operations or processes. We shall consider this
briefly in Section <a class="reference internal" href="#insideams-runtimeprocesses"><span class="std std-ref">Runtime Processes</span></a> but firstly we
shall turn our attention towards understanding evaluation moments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="understanding-evaluations-moments">
<span id="insideams-evalmoments"></span><h2>Understanding evaluations moments<a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-evaluations-moments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We have in the previous sections just mentioned that some variables are
evaluated before the configuration of the model and some after. This
divides the variables into constants and runtime variables. The value of
these variables can in principle be controlled in two ways, either by
objects using them, i.e., a system controlled value, or by expressions
that have been specified in the model, i.e., a (more) user controlled
value.</p>
<p>AnyBody has a dynamic evaluation scheme in which mathematical
expressions defined by in the script will be evaluated during runtime
processes. This is handled by assigning a so-called evaluation moment to
each variable. The evaluation moment specifies in principle when a user
controlled value will be evaluated and when system controlled values are
ready for use.</p>

</table>
<p>“Runtime variables” (or RuntimeVar) is a actually a common name for
several evaluation moments. These are not covered here in detail,
because they will be different depending on version and configuration of
the AnyBody system. It is so that a study class typically defines (or inherits)
certain evaluation moments that have to do with the specific steps in
the particular investigation of that study.</p>
<div class="section" id="runtime-processes">
<span id="insideams-runtimeprocesses"></span><h3>Runtime Processes<a class="headerlink" href="#runtime-processes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Runtime processes are started by the user by executing operations
(<a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyOperation.html#anyoperation"><span class="std std-ref">AnyOperation</span></a>-derived) from the AnyBody interface, be it the console or the GUI
application.</p>
<p>Operations are typically split into several steps that are
sequentially executed, such as the time steps of a simulation or
parameter variation steps of a parameter study. Both interfaces of
AnyBody allow you to do a complete execution of an operation as well as
stepwise execution. During stepwise execution you will be able to follow
the changes in the model for each step, whether as displayed image in
the Model View of the GUI application or as a value variation in dumbed
values of charts. Each step of an operation may involve one or more
<a class="reference internal" href="#insideams-evalmoments"><span class="std std-ref">evaluations moments</span></a> and after each “moment”
has occurred in the operation algorithm, the associated values are updated.</p>
<p>Runtime processes may be executed sequentially and occasionally also nested into
each other. <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyDesStudy.html#anydesstudy"><span class="std std-ref">Design studies</span></a> execute other operations in
order to investigate the impact of design changes. An evaluation moment
identifying the change of a design parameter is introduced prior to the the
above mentioned steps in the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyTimeStudy.html#anytimestudy"><span class="std std-ref">AnyTimeStudy</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/classes/AnyMechStudy.html#anymechstudy"><span class="std std-ref">AnyMechStudy</span></a>, and a later moment
is introduced to identify the end of the analysis operations. In this way, the
design study can change design parameters and and their dependent values, then
execute the analysis operation (or a sequence of several operations) updating
all its evaluation moments, and finally extract and compute design
characteristic output (so-called <em>design measures</em>) based on the final
evaluation moment of the design study.</p>

<h2>Using AnyBody from the console<a class="headerlink" href="#using-anybody-from-the-console" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<h3>AnyBody argument parser (tl;dr)<a class="headerlink" href="#anybody-argument-parser-tl-dr" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The AnyBody Argument Parser a text parser that handles arguments for the
AnyBody executables as well as for certain intern functions. The internal
functions are parsing arguments to commands in the AnyBody Macro Language,
arguments to Class Operations of AnyScript™ Objects, and arguments in in special
HTML-links the AnyBody GUI’s description views.</p>
<p>The actual arguments for the different case will not be covered here,
but this is how you find more information:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>AnyBodyCon.exe:</dt><dd><p>More details about the arguments for AnyBodyCon.exe can be obtained
by executing the program with the help option, ‘-?’</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="highlight-sh notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>AnyBodyCon.exe -?
</pre></div>
</div>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>AnyBody.exe:</dt><dd><p>Please refer to the following section in this document for more
details.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Class Operations:</dt><dd><p>Please refer to reference page for the given class in this document
or to the Object Description for a given object.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The basic principle of argument parsing in the AnyBody Argument Parser is the
same as in many console programs, i.e., you can add arguments to the
program or operation name using a short or a long argument name version.
For instance, the macro file name can be parsed to the  Console in the
following three way</p>
<div class="highlight-sh notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>AnyBodyCon.exe -m &lt;anymcr-file&gt;
AnyBodyCon.exe /m &lt;anymcr-file&gt;
AnyBodyCon.exe –macrofile<span class="o">=</span>&lt;anymcr-file&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The argument short name is ‘m’ and the lon name is ‘macrofile’</p>
<p>A special issue regarding The AnyBody Argument Parser is double-quoting
strings. Many arguments are names, file and directory paths, etc. that
needs to enclosed in double-quotes, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;</span></code>, in order to find spaces in the
string. The parser handles this and it treats the double-quotes as a
special characters (delimiters of argument values). This, however, is a
problem if you need to provide string arguments that must contain
double-quotes as characters. Working with single arguments for the
AnyBody executables or standard operations this is typically not an issue,
except when supplying strings values to  definition or the like (see the
small example below); but if you work with more advanced applications
such as executing Class Operations from macro script or executing any
kind of operation from HTML-links in the AnyBody description views, then you
will soon face this problem. In general, any application, where
arguments supplied to one AnyBody Argument Parser contain arguments that is
subsequently supplied to another argument parser, is a typical case of
this problem because arguments for the two (or more) levels of parser
becomes nested.</p>
<p>In order to by-pass the problem of nested double-quoting, the AnyBody Argument
Parser is equipped with an option where you can use so-called escaped double-quotes.
The syntax is like in C and C++, where the escape-character is the back-slash <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\</span></code>, i.e.,
the escaped double-quote is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*\&quot;</span></code> and to make a back-slash itself type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\\</span></code>. To enter the
special mode, your argument must be preceded by three dashes, i.e., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">---</span></code> (single- and
double-dash is used already, as short and long argument indicators).</p>
<p>Here is an example of the ‘load’ macro command executed with a
definition of MY_DEF equal to 5</p>
<div class="highlight-sh notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>load -def <span class="nv">MY_DEF</span><span class="o">=</span> ---<span class="s2">&quot;\&quot;5\&quot;&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where the standard appearance of this would be</p>
<div class="highlight-sh notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>load -def <span class="nv">MY_DEF</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;5&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The difference between these two statements is that the former will lead
to MY_DEF being a string containing ‘5’ as a single character, whereas
the latter lead to MY_DEF being an integer with value five.</p>
<p>Notice the escaped back-slash is particular important when dealing with
file paths as in the following example of the definition of a path: The
simple syntax for a path definition in a load command is</p>
<div class="highlight-sh notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>load -p <span class="nv">MY_PATH</span><span class="o">=</span>C:<span class="se">\T</span>emp<span class="se">\M</span>yFolder
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where the escaped method is need for a path containing spaces</p>
<div class="highlight-sh notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>load -def <span class="nv">MY_PATH</span> <span class="o">=</span> ---<span class="s2">&quot;C:\\Temp\\MyFolder&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
