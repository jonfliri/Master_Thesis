<h2>AnyBody, v.7.3.0 (07-07-2020)<a class="headerlink" href="#anybody-v-7-3-0-07-07-2020" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>AnyBody, v.7.3.0 provides several new features and minor updates. Many
of these are supporting the new version of the AnyBody Managed Model
Repository, AMMR v.2.3.</p>
<p>The installed version of AMMR is now version 2.3, which includes many
improvements and new examples. For example, a large-scale gait MoCap example, and a new graphical interface (plugin) to scale models based on statistical data.
In addition, numerous issues have been fixed and improved throughout the model codebase.
Please see the AMMR documentation for a full changelog (<a class="reference external" href="https://anyscript.org/ammr-doc/changelog.html">https://anyscript.org/ammr-doc/changelog.html</a>).</p>
<p>AnyBody, v.7.3.x installs separately from previous versions of AnyBody.</p>
<p><strong>New features:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>AnyScript Modeling Language:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyKinMeasureQuadComb.html#anykinmeasurequadcomb" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyKinMeasureQuadComb</span></a> is a new so-called kinematic combination measure.
It derives from <a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyKinMeasureLinComb.html#anykinmeasurelincomb" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyKinMeasureLinComb</span></a> that provides a linear combination of other kinematic measures.
<a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyKinMeasureQuadComb.html#anykinmeasurequadcomb" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyKinMeasureQuadComb</span></a> extends this with quadratic terms, i.e. the ability to make products of other measures.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyOutputBVH.html#anyoutputbvh" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyOutputBVH</span></a>: New output-file class that can save new kinematic data for a BVH model (<a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyInputBVH.html#anyinputbvh" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyInputBVH</span></a>).
This is useful if motion is predicted or otherwise modified with AnyBody and needs to be exported for use in another software, e.g. from where the BVH data orginated.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyInputBVH.html#anyinputbvh" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyInputBVH</span></a>: The new mode, introduced in v.7.2.3, for better handling of discontinuous (jumping) angular data
and direct generation of virtual marker data is now default, enabling a direct interface to a human model similar to <a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyInputC3D.html#anyinputc3d" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyInputC3D</span></a>.
Since v.7.2.3, the data organization has been improved slightly. The BVH model example in the AMMR has been updated accordingly.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Muscle and String Wrapping:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The closest point calculation speed for ellipsoids has been improved. This is particular important for string-wrapping in AnyKinSPLine,
and thereby in muscle wrapping, but it affects any kinematic measure that uses the ellipsoid surface.</p></li>
<li><p>More robust prediction for the next step for string-wrapping, i.e. for class <a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyKinSPLine.html#anykinspline" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyKinSPLine</span></a>. Important for <a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyMuscleShortestPath.html#anymuscleshortestpath" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyMuscleShortestPath</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>It is possible to enable a new and faster wrapping method compared to the standard one for class <a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyKinSPLine.html#anykinspline" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyKinSPLine</span></a>.
The new algorithm is still experimental.
To activate it for all shortest-path kinematic measures (<a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyKinSPLine.html#anykinspline" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyKinSPLine</span></a>) and wrapping muscles (<a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyMuscleShortestPath.html#anymuscleshortestpath" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyMuscleShortestPath</span></a>),
set this global handle “System.Compatibility.AnyBody73_ExperimentalShortestPathSolver = On;” in the AnyScript main folder.
The new method can also be activated for selected measures or muscles in the <a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyKinSPLine.html#anykinspline" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyKinSPLine</span></a> object.
The new algorithm is inspired by, but not a one to one implementation of the article “FAST AND ROBUST MUSCLE PATH WRAPPING FOR ARBITRARY SURFACES”
(<a class="reference external" href="https://isbweb.org/~tgcs/iscsb-2019/abstracts/40_P6-3.pdf">https://isbweb.org/~tgcs/iscsb-2019/abstracts/40_P6-3.pdf</a>), written by John E. Lloyd, Ian Stavness and Sidney Fels.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Graphical User Interface:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Model View:</strong> Several improvements that significantly improves interaction and configuration of the 3D view of model.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The AnyBody GUI Model View will now preserve the view state (hidden/shown objects, selection and opacity) when reloading a model.</p></li>
<li><p>The AnyBody GUI Model View now supports undo and redo of Model View interactions that change the view state as mentioned above.</p></li>
<li><p>The responsiveness of the Model View has been improved when interacting (rotating, zooming and panning) with it while running simulations.</p></li>
<li><p>The Model View Zoom to Fit action has been improved to only include visible objects and not always include the origin {0,0,0}.</p></li>
<li><p>The Model View will now test OpenGL support level before rendering begins. If insufficient support is detected,
this is now reported, and rendering is not attempted.
For instance, this typically occur when running AnyBody on a remote desktop.
The error message provides information on how to work around the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>The concept for auto-generated AnyDrawObjects (<a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyDrawObject.html#anydrawobject" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyDrawObject</span></a>) has been significantly expanded in this version.
This concept aims to enable the user to see most key mechanical features of the model without scripting specific drawing statement (i.e. entering drawing objects manually).
This new concept is key to browsing, understanding, and debugging your model.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Specifically, the following AnyScript classes now always contain drawing objects (typically named the prefix “view”:
<a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyRefFrame.html#anyrefframe" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyRefFrame</span></a>,
<a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnySeg.html#anyseg" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnySeg</span></a>,
<a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyStdJoint.html#anystdjoint" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyStdJoint</span></a>,
<a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyForceBase.html#anyforcebase" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyForceBase</span></a>,
<a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyForceSurfaceContact.html#anyforcesurfacecontact" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyForceSurfaceContact</span></a>,
<a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyKinMeasure.html#anykinmeasure" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyKinMeasure</span></a>,
<a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyMuscleViaPointBase.html#anymuscleviapointbase" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyMuscleViaPointBase</span></a>,
<a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyParamSurf.html#anyparamsurf" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyParamSurf</span></a></p></li>
<li><p>The AnyDrawObjects for these classes have by default their visibility set to Off, but they can be controlled through AnyScript and the Model Tree.</p></li>
<li><p>In the coming major version of AnyBody, it is planned that visibility of auto-generated drawing objects will change so that default visibility
will show model features more intuitively. This will minimize the need for manually created drawing objects,
but it will also require current models to be cleaned of excess of manually created drawing.
To enable smoother transition, we introduce this new functionality in coming minor versions (including this one) as an option.
To try the new mode, use the global options under “System.Drawing.DefaultVisibility” that control default visibility of the auto-generated drawing objects.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Chart View:</strong> The rendering defaults for the Chart View has been improved, including padding, vertical y-axis title and DPI screen scaling awareness.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Class View</strong> has a new group of entries for displaying key AnyScript classes.
This provides a new entry point to find the most used classes when programming your model.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Model Tree</strong> has new filter options to show or hide objects based their importance/features and to enable to see hidden objects (for instance deprecated objects).
The AnyScript language does not yet support the more advanced filtering features extensively, but this will be improved in coming AnyBody version, which enable to simplify the Model Tree
to provide better overview for more typical interaction. This will also affect the newer Component Tree that provides an alternative overview of the model contents.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minor updates:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>AnyScript Modeling Language:</strong></p>
<ul>

<li><p><a class="reference external" href="AnyScriptReference/reference/classes/AnyDesStudy.html#anydesstudy" title="(in AnyScript Reference v7.3)"><span>AnyDesStudy</span></a> and derived classes are now able to save/load changed design variables as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*.anyset</span></code> files
from the “Save design”/”Load design” Class Operations, which makes it easier to save and retrieve data for instance when design-studies

It will respect the user-defined color map also for activities above 1.0.</p></li>
<li><p>The default format when saving pictures from the modelview has changed from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bmp</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">png</span></code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Dynamic updating of certain drawing objects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The RGB values evaluation moment has been updated to be ModelSceneVar, so the color can be depending on time,
kinematic or kinetic variables.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Model loading speed has been improved by an average of 25%.</p></li>
<li><p>The collection of variables for output folders in studies has been improved, for instance so that it also
takes into account dependencies of non-floating point variables. Example: A variable that

<p>AnyBody, v.7.2.0 provides several new features and minor updates. Many
of these are supporting the new version of the AnyBody Managed Model
Repository, AMMR v.2.2.</p>
<p>The installed version of AMMR is now version 2.2, which includes many
improvements and new examples. For example, a new wrapping
implementation of the deltoid muscle, a new graphical UI for configuring
body models, and new knee simulator and posture prediction example
models. In addition, numerous issues have been fixed and improved
throughout the model codebase. Please see the AMMR documentation for a
full changelog (<a class="reference external" href="https://anyscript.org/ammr-doc/changelog.html">https://anyscript.org/ammr-doc/changelog.html</a>).</p>
<p>AnyBody, v.7.2.x installs separately from previous versions of AnyBody.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical User Interface:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Operation drop-down</strong> on the Main Frame toolbar:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The drop-down has been updated to use the new DisplayPriority
settings that are now available in all Operation’s settings (see
the AnyOprSetUI below). This is used for decluttering the
drop-down menu and emphasizing the important Operations of the
model.</p></li>
<li><p>The drop-down menu now contains an “Open Operation Tree” item,
which helps you find the Operation Tree if needed.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Model View</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Model View will now, by default, maximally use a fraction of
the total operation time for rendering updates. This fraction is
defined in the AnyBody Settings.</p></li>
<li><p>The Model View context menu has been updated to be more consistent
with other menus.</p></li>
<li><p>Geometry rendering has been updated to be more efficient.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Model Tree:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Support for selecting multiple objects has been added to the Model
Tree. This enables doing Model View interactions and viewing info
on multiple objects.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Chart View:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Multi-selected values in the Chart View now supports that not all
values need to be plottable. In this situation, only the plottable
values are displayed.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Layouts</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Layouts have been updated to support the Component Tree.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Information Window</strong>: Improved the handling of Documentation
Comments made in the AnyScript code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Component Tree</strong> is a new family of tree views that present the
model in a flatter structure than the Model Tree. This aims to help
to provide an overview of the key elements of a model. This new
structure is based on components and key important object types such
as muscles, segments, etc. The Component Trees show three categories
of elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Components</strong> are defined in the model script using the new
AnyScript class called AnyComponentDefinition. Components are
defined in the new version of AMMR (e.g. body parts) and can be
defined by the model developer for any environment part of the
model.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Objects of key types (classes)</strong> are selected by filters in the
Component Tree or by selecting one of the preselected Component
Trees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Groups:</strong> Objects of similar type and naming are grouped so that
for instance several muscles branches of the same physiological
muscle may be collected as a group.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New object icons:</strong> Key object types (classes) have got new
icons to make them clearly distinct in the Component and Model
Trees. Groups have similar icons but with a three-dot group
indicator.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>Component Trees</strong> are by default closed and must be opened from
the View menu.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The main Component Tree is found in the menu View-&gt;Components.
This Tree View has a flexible class filter to select which object
types to show in the view.</p></li>
<li><p>Preselected Component Trees are found in menu View-&gt;Preselected
Component Tree.</p></li>
<li><p>In future versions, when the view has been fully equipped, it will
be open as a default view for model interaction. You can keep the
view open by saving your preferred layout.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>AnyBody Exporter™ for SOLIDWORKS®</strong> has been updated to optionally
exporting a model containing Component definitions for better
Component Tree support.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Menus, toolbars and hotkeys:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Replay toolbar’s</strong> responsiveness has been greatly improved.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a hotkey (Alt-W-W) for opening the editor list.</p></li>
<li><p>Tooltips have been improved for completeness.</p></li>
<li><p>A new “Locate in file tree” menu function has been added to the
editor file tabs context menus.</p></li>
<li><p>Support has been added for using the Copy hotkey (Ctrl-C) in more
windows.</p></li>
<li><p>A new hotkey (Ctrl-Shift-C) has been added for copying the
complete name of an object in a tree.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New features:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Muscle modeling updates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Metabolism models</strong>: 2 new metabolic energy models have been
added to the system to complement the existing simple, constant
efficiency model build into AnyBodyStudy. It is the metabolism
models by Bahargava et. al. 2004 and Umberger et. al. 2010 (and
2003) that are added. This has been implemented as a new set of
classes derived from a metabolic model base class
(AnyMetabModelBase). Three derived classes contain the model by
Bahargava et. al. (AnyMetabModelB), the models by Umberger et. al.
(AnyMetabModelU), and the previously built-in model
(AnyMetabModelSimple), respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>All metabolic models have default parameters from the literature,
but parameters can be modified. For instance, the Umberger 2003
model is obtained by setting specific parameter values in
AnyMetabModelU, which has default values from Umberger 2010. This
also enables you to change the parameters of the built-in model.</p></li>
<li><p>AnyBodyStudy holds a new member to set the default metabolic model
to be used for all muscles in the study.</p></li>
<li><p>Each muscle object does also hold a new member to set it
specifically for that muscle enabling to set different parameter
values per muscle.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>GUI Plugins:</strong> A new plug-in system for making GUIs associated with
specific models has been made available in AnyBody. Prototypes were
available in previous 7.x.x version and betas, but now it is official
and AMMR 2.2 uses it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>AnyBody GUI Plugin Interface:</strong> The interface is still intended
mainly for AnyBody Technology development purposes and is not
documented publicly. However, it is fully exposed for AnyBody
users and all developed plug-ins provided in AMMR can in principle
be modified together with the AMMR model code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Human Body Model (BM) Configurator in AMMR</strong>: AMMR 2.2 uses the
plug-in interface and contains an AMMR GUI for configurating the
body model. The AMMR contains more informaton about this plugin.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Python Distribution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Anybody installer now includes a Python 3.7 distribution
suitable for use with the AnyBody GUI Plugin system and for many
typical AnyScript Python functions.</p></li>
<li><p>The Python distribution supplied in the installer is now used by
default, but a user-specified Python can be configured for both
AnyBody GUI Plugins and AnyScript Python functions, by setting
ANYBODY_PATH_PYTHONHOME and ANYBODY_PATH_PLUGINPYTHONHOME paths in
AnyScript.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minor updates:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Kinematic solvers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Kinematic solvers have been updated to use a new Intel MKL
version. This has improved the stability, but at the cost of some
extra computational time.</p></li>
<li><p>The over-determinate kinematic solver has been equipped with a
fallback method that allows it to retry with different initial
start conditions a few times. This has also improved robustness
for modeling using soft kinematics.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>AnyBody Exporter™ for SOLIDWORKS®:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>An AnyScript warning will now be generated when the SOLIDWORKS
model contains non-convertible mates.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for the Component Tree has been added, as the exporter now
generates <strong>AnyComponentDefinition</strong> AnyScript objects when
appropriate.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Python support:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Python 3.7 support added.</p></li>
<li><p>Python 2.6 support removed.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>AnyScript modeling language:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>AnyComponentDefinition</strong> mentioned above.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AnyMetabModelSimple</strong>, <strong>AnyMetabModelB</strong>, <strong>AnyMetabModelU</strong>
are three new metabolic model classes, see above.</p></li>
<li></li>
<li><p><strong>AnyDrawSurf</strong> and <strong>AnySurfSTL:</strong> New member function
<strong>GetVertices</strong> for returning STL surface vertex coordinates from
vertex indices. This function is useful for setting up bone
dependent scaling functions, specifying landmarks, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AnyDrawSurfDynShape</strong>: New class supporting dynamic updates to
the surface shape. Its functionality was extracted from
AnyDrawSurf, see below<strong>.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>AnyDrawSurf:</strong> DynUpdateOnOff member has been marked as
deprecated and is no longer functional.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AnyInputBVH:</strong> Behavior has been updated to handle 6 channels
correctly. A new member <strong>AddTranslationsToOffset</strong> has been added
for optionally reverting to the old behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AnyOperationSetValue</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Operation has been made easier to use when setting multiple
target value-objects to the same value.</p></li>
<li><p>Operation speed has been improved as well.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>AnyOprSetUI</strong> (the settings folder in all operations i.e.
AnyOperation) has got new options to control operation
priority/visibility in the AMS GUI. This helps the model builder
to show/highlight the more important operations to the model user,
and hide less important ones<strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A new enum member <strong>DisplayPriority</strong> has been added for
controlling the GUI Operation drop-down visibility of the
parent AnyOperation.</p></li>
<li><p>A new AnySwitch member <strong>SelectOnLoad</strong> has been added for
controlling if the parent AnyOperation should be selected on
load.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>AnyKinMeasureProd:</strong> This class has been deprecated, as
<strong>AnyKinMeasureLinComb</strong> will get the same functionality.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Model loading speed has been improved.</p></li>
<li><p>‘repmat(..)’ function now supports AnyObjectPtr types.</p></li>
<li><p>The surface contact error message used upon failure has been improved
to report both objects involved (e.g. muscle and surface).</p></li>
<li><p>The default formatting of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">strval(..)</span></code> function has been
changed to be more readable.</p></li>
<li><p>The behavior when double-clicking .any files in Windows has been
improved to open files in a currently running instance of AnyBody if
possible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugfixes:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fixed a bug where occasionally a muscle wrapping AnyKinSPLine would
wrap the wrong way. This error was related to reuse of muscle path
conditions from previous studies for the initiation of the next, so
the error could happen in sequences of studies with different time
spans.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fixed a bug where an incomplete load could cause a crash.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug where many opened files in the editor would degrade
performance.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed an issue causing crash when shutting down AnyBody.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug in AnyFile, where a special sequence of HTML encoded
characters in the filename could cause a failure to load.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug where a Documentation Comment in the top-level object in
the Model Tree could cause a crash.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed an issue where the Model View recording counter was not updated
properly.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed an issue in the editor where newly opened file tabs would be
placed at the far right. They are now placed next to the currently
viewed file.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug where the Editor scroll position would jump after
scrolling and clicking in the editor.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed the “Locate in Script” behavior from the File Tree.</p></li>

<p>The release contains bug-fixes and a few minor features.</p>
<p>New version of AnyBody Managed Model Repository (AMMR) version 2.1 is
included. The updated AMMR includes a few new example models, numerous
improvements and smaller bug fixes. Please refer to the dedicated
release notes in the AMMR documentation.</p>
<p><strong>New features:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Preprocessor</strong>: New #ifpathexists and #ifnpathexists AnyScript preprocessor
conditions. These provide functionality for using the existence of a
path as a controlling condition in the AnyScript preprocessor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AnyFunTransform3D functions speedup</strong>: Implemented a caching based
speedup for AnyFunTransform3D derived functions, in order to prevent
unnecessary re-evaluation during design updates.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minor updates:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Chart View now supports using wildcard-selections (using “*”) even
when this includes non-plottable objects such as folders. Now
plottable values are displayed in the chart and folder objects are
ignored.</p></li>
<li><p>The numerical precision used when outputting <strong>AnyFloat</strong> values to
ANYSET files and through the Dump ClassOperations has been increased
to ensure that the values can be imported again without loss of
precision.</p></li>
<li><p>The numerical precision used for the <strong>smootherstep</strong> and
<strong>smoothramp</strong> AnyScript functions has been improved.</p></li>
<li><p>The Replay <strong>AnyOperations</strong> have been removed from the Operation
drop-down menu as replay functionality is already available via
dedicated toolbar buttons and draggable progress bar.</p></li>
<li><p>Updated the <strong>AnyInputC3D</strong> reader to accept certain non-conforming
C3D files, even though they do not adhere to the standard.</p></li>
<li><p>In the editor, files are now always opened to the right of the active
file.</p></li>
<li><p>A new entry in the settings file for enabling crash-dump logging has
been added. This will force a recreation of the settings file on
first startup of this version of AnyBody. We apologize for any lost
settings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugfixes:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fixed an error that occur when using the Set Value dialog box for
setting an AnyFile value.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a graphical issue with the Set Value dialog box when using a
DPI scaling different from 100%.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed an issue that could result in duplicate entries to choose
from when using “Locate in Model Tree”.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a crash that could occur when trying to open the Help on
something other than an AnyScript object.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed an unnecessary log file that was sometimes created when
using certain AnyScript classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed an issue where the “Plot Value” right-click context menu
would not be available for AnyOutputFloats in the Model Tree.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed unnecessary Model View diagnostics messages, which would
sometimes be included in the log files for the AnyBody Console
application.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fixed multiple editor related issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>AnyBody would not restore the editor scroll position when
reloading a file modified outside AnyBody.</p></li>
<li><p>Answering “no” to reloading a file modified outside AnyBody
would not mark the file as being modified in AnyBody.</p></li>
<li><p>Answering “no” to reloading a file modified outside AnyBody
would make the dialog display again continuously.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed crash that could occur when double-clicking in an empty
file.</p></li>
<li><p>Updated the check for modified files to only occur when the
AnyBody Modeling System has focus.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed an issue where starting the AnyBody Modeling System by double
clicking an ANY file would sometimes cause a Windows error dialog box
to appear.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a problem in AnyInputC3D with the logic behind

</ul>
<p><strong>New features:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Muscle Modeling updates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>AnyMuscleModel</strong> has been extended with two parameters, so it
now holds nominal strength (F0), volume (Vol0) and fiber length
(Lf0). This is preparation for future versions which will use
these parameters in the muscle recruitment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Variables Lfbar, Epsilonbar and Gammabar are deprecated</strong>:
Derived classes <strong>(AnyMuscleModel3E and AnyMuscleModel2ELin),</strong>
which previously had Lf0 equivalent variables (i.e. Lfbar) now
have deprecated members. All variable with the &quot;bar&quot; postfix are
now deprecated and replaced by similar variables with postfix
&quot;0&quot;. Deprecated variables are still operational for backwards
compatibility, but it is recommended to upgrade as part of model
maintenance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Muscle calibration</strong> can set fiber length of all muscle types.</p></li>
<li><p>New base class for AnyMuscle called AnyRecruitedForce has been
introduced. In future versions other force types, which also will
be determined by muscle recruitment, will be derived from this
base class.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Calibration studies (AnyBodyCalibrationStudy)</strong> has been updated
for handling the new muscle model parameters, see above.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>More consistent handling of muscle/ligament inclusion by the
pointer lists (using members MuscleArr and LigamentArr) has been
introduced. This implies that muscle/ligaments that are not
explicit part of the model of the study can be included.</p></li>
<li><p>Links to muscle model parameters (design variables) can break
expression and assign values, that would previously lead to
loading errors. Calibrated parameters will now also be saved
together with other modified variables in ANYSET files.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>AnyStudy and derived classes</strong> have improved model configuration
functionality.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mechanical studies (<strong>AnyMechStudyBase</strong> and derived classes) can
find and include missing mechanical dependencies that were not
manually included in the study. Or they warn about missing
segments.</p></li>
<li><p>Expression handling in all studies has been updated, so that
expressions of objects that are either automatically picked up or
manually excluded are also similarly included or excluded.
Expression handling is thereby consistent with the updated
configuration functionality.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Mechanical studies</strong> have new system information functions</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Kinematic error information has been slightly improved.</p></li>
<li><p>Study object’s Object Description has been extended with more
information about connections between segments and kinematical
constraints.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>New ‘argfind’ function</strong>: Function for finding index of first
occurrence of a value in an array.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minor updates:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>AnyBody Exporter™ for SOLIDWORKS®:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Official support for SOLIDWORKS 2018 added.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>AnyScript classes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>AnyDoc:</strong> New AnyScript class for adding documentation (links)
to your model. The documentation is accessible in the GUI through
a button in the Model Tree. AnyDoc objects can assign
documentation to AnyFolder objects, which implies that it can be
assigned to any part and at any level of your model. The new AMMR
uses this feature to link the model to specific documentation
enclosed with the model.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AnyInputFile</strong> is extended with new options that improve
interfacing with files while the model is loaded<strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>a new AlwaysData0 switch, which force the AnyInputFile to
disregard the file data and use the default data (T0/Data0)
instead.</p></li>
<li><p>new TFile member, which holds data from the time array (first
column) in the file. This is useful for checking validating the
file content and setting AlwaysData0 accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>a new TFileNumRead, which holds the number of time data (rows)
read from the file.</p></li>
<li><p>a new TFileIsMonotoneIncreasing member, which indicates if the
file contains a time array which is monotonically increasing.
This is useful for checking validating the file content and
setting AlwaysData0 accordingly.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>AnyForceSurfaceContact</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Added ProjectionThresholdMaster and -Slave members for
finetuning contact areas in situations where mesh surfaces have
sharp edges and large curvatures between contacting surfaces.</p></li>
<li><p>Added an option to AnyDrawForceSurface to visualize the
connection between contact points on the master and slave
surfaces.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Optimization incl. Kinematic Optimization:</strong> Handling of
requirements for design variables has been improved to support model
development and integration with template models such as the new
AnyMoCap included in AMMR.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Muscle wrapping (with AnyKinSPLine):</strong> New parameters enable
increasing robustness for difficult cases. MaxIteration enables
increasing solver iterations while MaxRelStepSize enables to
increasing robustness by enforcing smaller step-sizes. In addition,
handling of the absolute tolerance (AbsTol) has been improved.</p></li>
<li><p>Improved the model loading speed.</p></li>
<li><p>Improved the startup speed of AMS and removed screen flickering
during startup.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AnyDrawSurf:</strong> Changed DynUpdateOnOff to be Off as default. Having
this as On can cause a massive slowdown of the Model View.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AnyKinStudy:</strong> Changed the SmallStepAssumptions value for
InitialConditions to be Off as default.</p></li>
<li><p>The AnyBody Console application will now exit immediately with code
-22 in noninteractive mode when no licenses are available.</p></li>
<li><p>Improved the error message that is shown for invalid references, so
that it now displays the first invalid object on the path.</p></li>
<li><p>‘repmat’ function now supports 0-length (empty) output.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugfixes:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Fixed a bug where using AnyDrawPointCloud occasionally caused a
crash.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug where the AnyBody console application might crash with an
unknown error when exiting.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed wrong background colors in the editor tabs.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed an issue where deprecated Operations might be displayed in the
Operations Tree.</p></li>

Window.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a crash, which could occur through indirect use of an #undef’ed
macro.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a crash, which would happen when <strong>AnyForceSurfaceContact</strong>
found large amounts of contact points in a continuous contact region.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug where the right side of the window for Settings and
Properties would not show anything.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed an error where the Project Tree view would not be activated
when a model containing an <strong>AnyProject</strong> is loaded.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed an issue where <strong>AnyObjectPtr</strong> was not correctly recognized in

<h2>AnyBody, v.7.0.1 (06-07-2017)<a class="headerlink" href="#anybody-v-7-0-1-06-07-2017" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The release contains bug-fixes and a few minor features that were not
ready for the 7.0.0 release.</p>
<p><strong>New features:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Back/forward navigation buttons</strong>: New model tree navigation
buttons. The buttons allow the user to quickly jump between
selections in the model tree.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operation dropdown on toolbar:</strong> New operation dropdown widget in
the toolbar makes it easier to see which operation is currently
active, and makes it easier to switch between the most important
operations without having to select them in the model/operations
tree.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New system for auto-generated drawing objects:</strong> Objects for
auto-generated drawings (RefFrames, Nodes, Inertia) are now real
objects in the model tree. The objects are prefixed with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">view</span></code>
(i.e. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">viewRefFrame</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">viewNodes</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">viewInertia</span></code>). They are not
visible by default but can be enabled from the model tree or the
model view. Since the objects are real AnyScript objects they can be
customized and modified by the model developer. The remaining
auto-generated drawings of other kinds of objects will be added in
the future.</p></li>
<li><p>New <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">assert()</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">expect()</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">warn()</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">notice()</span></code> AnyScript
functions: Simple functions for asserting variables. The functions
raise errors if the inputs evaluate to false or zero (0). The
functions are intended as a convenient way to generate user-defined
error, warning, and notice messages. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">expect()</span></code> function
generates non-critical error messages, while the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">assert()</span></code>
function raises a fatal error which prevents the model from
loading.</p></li>
<li><p>New <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bool()</span></code> function: Function for converting values to their
truth values (0 or 1).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minor updates:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Improve the performance of objects which resulted in large amount of
the text data (eg. large arrays).</p></li>
<li><p>Locate in AnyScript dialog: If multiple results are available the
first entry is now always the place where the object is
constructed.</p></li>
<li><p>Object information window: File construction links for class
members now points to where the variable is initialized instead of
the parent class constructs the variable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reset factory layout</strong>: Now possible to do a complete reset to the
factory layout.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>License concurrency</strong>: Implemented license concurrency so that a
single license of AnyBody can now run 4 simultaneous instances of
AnyBody GUI or Console, or any combination thereof.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugfixes:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New features:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Full model replay functionality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Replay functionality is now full featured and supports going back
and forth in time using the new replay buttons and replay slider.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Project feature:</strong> New “Project” feature to store settings such
as windows layouts, Model/Chart View etc. which are related to
specific project.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New AnyScript functions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>New AnyScript functions for initializing MxN matrices:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ones(m,n)</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zeros(m,n)</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">eye(m,n)</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>New AnyScript function to create evenly spaced numbers over a
specified interval: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">linspace(start,</span> <span class="pre">stop,</span> <span class="pre">num)</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>New AnyScript function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">repmat(m,n,</span> <span class="pre">arr)</span></code> to repeat an array or
matrix MxN times.</p></li>
<li><p>New AnyScript function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">smootherstep(edge0,</span> <span class="pre">edge1,</span> <span class="pre">x)</span></code> to create
a smooth sigmoid like step function transitioning from 0 at
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">edge0</span></code> to 1 at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">edge1</span></code>. First and second order derivatives
are zero at the edge points.
 (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep</a>). Useful for creating
interpolation functions with smooth transitions. This is
especially useful for kinematics weights etc..</p></li>
<li><p>New AnyScript function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">smoothramp(edge0,</span> <span class="pre">edge1,</span> <span class="pre">x)</span></code> to generate
a smooth ramp function which transition from 0 at Edge0 to 0.5 at
Edge1 where the function reaches its maximum constant slope of 2x.
First and second order derivatives are zero at the edge points.
Useful for creating smooth ramp functions. This is useful when
synthesizing curves for interpolation functions. E.g. for
kinematic penalties functions as used with the AnyScript class
AnyKinMeasureFunComb1.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>AnyC3DInput:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A new option to the AnyInputC3D object to gap fill the
trajectories based on the residual values has been added. Gap
filling is done crudely with linear interpolation, so it is not
meant to replace gap filling in motion capture software, but it
gives the option to low-pas filter data with marker
dropouts (markers moving suddenly to {0,0,0}) without the filter
group delay affects the marker positions before and after the
dropout.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minor updates:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>AnyScript functions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The logical AnyScript function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">iffun(..)</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">andfun(..)</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">orfun(..)</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nor(..)</span></code> now supports <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">On/Off</span></code> (AnySwitch)
values.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RotMat()</span></code> AnyScript function now supports integer
arguments, which just converted to floating values.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">round()</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">floor()</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ceil()</span></code> no longer complain if
they are given arguments which are already integers.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Kinematic errors:</strong> Improvements to how kinematics errors are
reported in the Output Window.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tutorials:</strong> The &quot;Getting started ...&quot; and &quot;User Interface&quot;
tutorials have been updated to reflect the new look-and-feel and
features of AMS 7.0.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugfixes:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Kinematic solvers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fixed a bug that prevented the KinSolDeterminate solver to be used
efficiently with FDK analysis.  The solver now supports same
abilities for linear perturbation analysis of positions as the
older solvers.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed bug in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">round(..)</span></code> AnyScript function on how negative
numbers were rounded up/down.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix bug in AnySurfEllipsoidFit introduced in AMS 6.1.1, which could
cause incorrect scale of the fitted ellipsoids.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed incorrect line numbers in the AnyScript Editor; now the first
line is 1 instead of 0.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed the incorrect flag ANYBODY_INSTALL_DIR on 64-bit AMS.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Known Issues:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Model tree: Model tree does not recover accurately the folders that
are open just before reload. Instead, all folders which has
previously been touched will be opened. This will be fixed in the
next minor update.</p></li>
<li><p>Tutorials: The remaining tutorials apart from the &quot;Getting started&quot;
and &quot;User Interface&quot; still need to be updated to reflect the new
look-and-feel of AMS 7.0. Even though the tutorials are based on
version 6.0 of AMS, the content is still valid.</p></li>
<li><p>The ability to display default drawings of objects after the model is
loaded (reframes, segments) currently does not work. We are working
on a new improved system for drawing default representations of
objects. This functionality will be reestablished soon in the next
minor update.</p></li>
